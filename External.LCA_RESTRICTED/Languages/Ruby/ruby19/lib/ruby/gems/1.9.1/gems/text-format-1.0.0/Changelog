== Text::Format 1.0.0
* Changed installer: added a .gem package.
* Changed installer: moving to a variant of setup.rb by Minero Aoki.
* Fixed significant problems with #hard_margin wrapping and fallback issues,
  eliminating all known possibilities for an infinite loop in wrapping. Some
  of the formatting changes involved with this result in different and more
  subtle wrapping and splitting of words; please read the full documentation
  for details.
* Clarified the API for #hyphenate_to (delineated the return value required if
  the hyphenator cannot hyphenate the word to the specified size).
* Changed a number of public and private API calls to work better. As long as
  the constants provided by Text::Format have been used (and not direct access
  to the constant values), there will be no issues presented by most of these
  changes.
* Changed the initialization of the Text::Format object. The documentation has
  also been updated to be correct. Note that this will mean that some uses of
  Text::Format will not work, as Text::Format.new now yields +self+ if a block
  is given instead of evaluating the block with Object#instance_eval.
* Added text numbering generators (Text::Format::Alpha, Text::Format::Number,
  and Text::Format::Roman) to work with #tag_paragraphs and #tag_text to
  generate numbered paragraphs.
* #nobreak_regex must be a hash of regular expressions, not strings that are
  converted to regular expressions. This Perlism has finally been removed.
* The performance has been improved; the number of times that lines are joined
  together and then split apart has been reduced.
* Changed the dependency to Text::Hyphen from TeX::Hyphen.
* Added auto-split capabilities to #paragraphs. See the updated documentation.

== Text::Format 0.64
* Fixed a bug where a NoMethod exception would be raised if #paragraphs was
  called with either (" ") or ([" "]).

== Text::Format 0.63
* Fixed a bug where a crash would occur when a hyphenator returned nil instead
  of "".

== Text::Format 0.62
* Modified the API for hyphenators. Previously, a hyphenator could only be
  defined as an object containing a method #hyphenate_to with the signature:
      #hyphenate_to(word, size)
  Now, the #hyphenate_to method may be the above signature or:
      #hyphenate_to(word, size, formatter)
  So that the hyphenator may access information about the formatting object,
  if necessary. Thanks to Tim Bates for suggesting a case where this would be
  useful.
* Fixed a bug for strings matching /\A\s*\Z/ raising a NameError.
* Fixed a test case that failed uner 1.6.8. The following no longer works:
      l, m1, m2 = /((?:\S+\s+){11})(.+)/.match(line)
  This has been replaced with an explicit use of l[1] and l[2]. Thanks to Tim
  Bates for finding this problem.
* Changed installer to Phil Thomson's install-package wrapper.

== Text::Format 0.61
* Fixed a problem with the installer. Note that Text::Format is no longer case
  sensitive for require purposes. It will be required as:
      require 'text/format'
  Versions earlier than 0.60 were case-sensitive. Please be aware of this if
  you are installing Text::Format over an older version. It may not replace
  the existing library in the way that you expect.

== Text::Format 0.60
* Added Symbol equivalents for the Hash initialization. Hash initialization
  has been modified so that values are set as follows (Symbols are highest
  priority; strings are middle; defaults are lowest):
    @columns = arg[:columns] || arg['columns'] || @columns
* Fixed a problem with Text::Format::RIGHT_FILL handling where a single word
  is larger than #columns.
* Removed Comparable mixin (<=> doesn't make sense; == does).
* Added #hard_margins, #split_rules, #hyphenator, and #split_words. Text
  formatted with #hard_margins will have words larger than #columns split
  forcibly. Words forcibly split will be placed into #split_words. See the
  documentation for important information on how this feature works.

== Text::Format 0.52.2
* Fixed the ordering of #<=> in cases of Boolean values.
* Fixed #expand and #unexpand Array handling.
* Added a Changelog.

== Text::Format 0.52.1
* Fixed a problem when tabs aren't counted properly.
* Changed #abbreviations from Hash to Array to better suit Ruby's
  capabilities.
* Fixed problems with the way that Array arguments are handled in calls to the
  major object types.

== Text::Format 0.52
* Initial release
