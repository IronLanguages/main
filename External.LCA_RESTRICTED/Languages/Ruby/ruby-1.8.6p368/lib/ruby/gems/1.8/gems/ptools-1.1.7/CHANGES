== 1.1.7 - 28-Jul-2009
* Now compatible with Ruby 1.9.x.
* Replaced RUBY_PLATFORM with rbconfig check for the sake of other
  implementations, such as JRuby.
* Updated the tests to be more friendly to JRuby.
* Added Test::Unit 2.x as a development dependency.
* Renamed the test files.

== 1.1.6 - 31-Aug-2007
* Fixed the File.touch method so that it doesn't whack existing files. Thanks
  go to Thomas Preymesser for the spot.
* Added corresponding tests to the tc_touch.rb file.

== 1.1.5 - 19-Jul-2007
* Added the File.image? method. Inspired by ruby-talk: 260487. 

== 1.1.4 - 21-May-2007
* Removed the install.rb file. Installation is now handled exclusively by the
  rake install task.
* Updated the MANIFEST file, and made it rdoc friendly.
* Manual installation corrections in the README file.

== 1.1.3 - 29-Apr-2007
* I changed the way that the constants IS_WINDOWS and WIN32EXTS are defined.
* The IS_WINDOWS and WIN32EXTS are no long documented publically. They were
  never meant for public use.
* The tc_constants.rb file was modified to only run certain tests on Windows.

== 1.1.2 - 28-Apr-2007
* Fixed a require line that could cause problems on MS Windows.
* Added a Rakefile which includes tasks for installation and testing.
* Some cleanup and improvement in the various test files.

== 1.1.1 - 24-Aug-2006
* Added the File.binary? method, based on code from Ryan Davis.

== 1.1.0 - 23-Aug-2006
* Added the File.null method which returns the bit bucket on your platform.
* The suffixes on MS Windows are now based on the PATHEXT environment variable,
  and defaults to '.com', '.bat' and '.exe' only if it's not defined.
* The File.which and File.whereis methods were tweaked a bit for Windows so
  that they ignore the case of suffixes.
* Modified the platform checking and path separator handling.
* Added and tweaked some tests.

== 1.0.0 - 2-Jun-2005
* Modified the File.middle method to accept an optional block.
* File.whereis is now limited to unique values so that redundant PATH entries
  do not cause redundant entries in the returned array (or block).
* File.nl_convert and File.touch now return self.
* File.nl_convert now raises ArgumentError (instead of StandardError) if
  an unknown platform is provided.
* File.wc now raises ArgumentError (instead of RuntimeError) if a bad option
  is provided.
* Made documentation rdoc friendly.
* Test suite updates, corrections and additions.
* Removed the INSTALL file.  See the README instead.
* Moved project to RubyForge.

== 0.1.3 - 5-Dec-2003
* Modified File#which and File#whereis for Win32 to handle extensions better,
  i.e. you can send "ruby" or "ruby.exe" and get back the same result.
* Minor test changes to tc_which.rb and tc_whereis.rb.

== 0.1.2 - 14-May-2003
* Modified nl_convert() to allow the destination filename to be the same as the
  source file.  In that case, a tempfile is used and copied back over the
  original file.
* The target file name for nl_convert() now defaults to the source file name and
  the default format is now "dos".
* Added a tc_constants.rb test suite.
* Test suite additions/fixes.
* Updates to MANIFEST.

== 0.1.1 - 21-Mar-2003
* Modified File.tail to return data in the same order that 'tail' does.
* Modified File.which to return nil if the program is not found.
* Modified File.whereis now uses '\' instead of '/' on MS Windows.
* Added File.middle class method.
* Test suite modification & additions.
* Thanks go to Shanko for both the spot and patch for tail, which, whereis
  and middle.

== 0.1.0 - 18-Mar-2003
* Initial release
