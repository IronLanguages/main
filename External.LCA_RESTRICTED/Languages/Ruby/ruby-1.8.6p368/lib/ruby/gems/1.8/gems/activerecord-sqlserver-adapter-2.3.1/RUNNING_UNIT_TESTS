== Creating the test database

The default names for the test databases are "activerecord_unittest" and 
"activerecord_unittest2". If you want to use another database name then be sure 
to update the connection adapter setups you want to test with in 
test/connections/<your database>/connection.rb. 

The connection files make certain assumptions. For instance, the ODBC connection 
assumes you have a DSN setup that matches the name of the default database names.


== Requirements

The following gems need to be installed. Make sure you have gems.github.com as a
source. Info here. http://gems.github.com/

We use echoe for packagemanagement to rubyforge. Not needed really for the tests 
but since we need it... you need to install it.

  * gem install echoe
  * gem install thoughtbot-shoulda -s http://gems.github.com
  * gem install mocha

The tests of this adapter depend on the existence of rails checkout. All the tests
defined by rails are re-used. For this to work the following directory structure 
is assumed to exist:

#{RAILS_ROOT}/vendor/plugins/adapters/sqlserver
#{RAILS_ROOT}/vendor/rails/activerecord/test

Define a user named 'rails' in SQL Server with all privileges granted for the 
test databases. Use an empty password for said user.


== Running with Rake

The easiest way to run the unit tests is through Rake. Either run "rake test_sqlserver" 
or "rake test_sqlserver_odbc". For more information, checkout the full array 
of rake tasks with "rake -T"

Rake can be found at http://rake.rubyforge.org


== Running with Autotest

Using autotest is easy, just run "autotest" and the tests will run continually in the 
same order as the rake test command. By default autotest will use ODBC connection. If 
you want to change this you can edit the autotest/sqlserver.rb file and set odbc_mode 
to false.

Lastly, you can run autotest on just the adapter specific tests with "autotest sqlserver". 
This will continuously run ONLY the SQL Sever specific behavior tests which are much 
quicker to run than the entire active record test suite.


== Running by hand

Unit tests are located in test directory. If you only want to run a single test suite, 
you can do so with:

   rake test_sqlserver TEST=base_test.rb
   
That'll run the base suite using the SQLServer-Ruby adapter.
