= Configuring Log4r with Log4r::YamlConfigurator

The YamlConfigurator class allows one to set up Log4r via YAML.
It is used almost exactly as Log4r::Configurator and has the same features,

  ycfg = YamlConfigurator    # handy shorthand
  ycfg['foo'] = bar          # replaces instances of #{foo} in the YAML with bar
  ycfg.load_yaml_file('foo.yaml')

Ruby 1.7 and 1.8 comes with a YAML parser. Hence, YAML can be used
to configure Log4r out of the box.

A comprehensive example of a Log4r YAML configuration is provided in the 
examples directory.

To use this class:

  require 'log4r/yamlconfigurator'

Thanks to Andreas Hund for making this possible.
