= 0.5.0 - 12-Sep-2008
* Fixed an issue for Windows Vista and later where some event descriptions
  were missing. This fix requires windows-pr 0.9.3 or later.
* The EventLog#full? method now raises an EventLog::Error if it should fail
  instead of a StandardError.
* Minor tweak to mc.rb - chomp the input file name if run as a program.
* Added test-unit 2.0.0 or later as a dependency.
* Added ptools as a dependency for the sake of the test suite.
* Renamed the test files to start with 'test_'.
* Removed the ts_all.rb file.

= 0.4.9 - 7-Sep-2008
* The private get_description method, which is used internally to read the
  event log, has been updated to work with 64 bit Windows. The changes needed
  for this require a more recent windows-pr library, i.e. 0.9.2 or later.
* Now properly separates the string inserts and description in the private
  method get_last_event. This fixes the description and string_insert
  properties for both the EventLog#tail and EventLog#notify_change methods.
* Some internal refactoring to use begin/ensure where appropriate.

= 0.4.8 - 17-May-2008
* Fixed in a bug in the EventLog#read method where a log entry requiring
  over 64k would fail and spiral into an infinite loop. Thanks go to
  Stuart Clarke for the spot.
* Improved handling of failed log reading in the read_last_event private
  method.

= 0.4.7 - 8-Dec-2007
* Fixed a bug where you couldn't write to custom (parent) event sources.
  Thanks go to Tim Uckun for the spot.
* Now handles ParameterMessageFiles, both in the EventLog.add_event_source
  method and in terms of getting event descriptions properly. Thanks go to
  botp for spotting the description problem.
* The EventLog.open_backup method handles a block the same way that the
  EventLog.open method does.
* The EventLog.add_event_source now returns the creation disposition
  instead of self.

= 0.4.6 - 27-Aug-2007
* Reading event logs is now approximately 5-7 times faster!
* Fixed a potential bug where, in rare cases, event descriptions could be
  overwritten by other event descriptions.
* Fixed a bug where, in unusual cases, there was leading garbage in the
  event descriptions.

= 0.4.5 - 25-Aug-2007
* Fixed two potential issues where reading from remote event log sources
  could fail either due to permissions (reading DLL's) or because local
  registry entries didn't necessarily match the remote registry entries.
  Thanks go to Andrew Garberoglio and Ivan Shiel for the spot.

= 0.4.4 - 31-Jul-2007
* The EventLogError class is now EventLog::Error.
* The MCError class is now MC::Error.
* Added a Rakefile with tasks for installation and testing.
* Removed the install.rb file. Installation is now handled by the Rakefile.
* Fixed some bad test cases in tc_eventlog.rb.
* Added some more source comments.
* Updates to the README and MANIFEST file.

= 0.4.3 - 18-Dec-2006
* Removed the FORMAT_MESSAGE_FROM_SYSTEM flag to the FormatMessage function
  in the get_description private method because it could sometimes return
  bogus information.  Thanks go to Greg Holmes for the spot.
* Added the string_inserts member to the EventLogStruct.  This contains an
  array of only the raw string inserts, rather than the entire text message.

= 0.4.2 - 6-Aug-2006
* Fixed a bug in the EventLog.read method related to the
  EVENTLOG_BACKWARDS_READ flag.
* Fixed a bug in the EventLog.read method where the event_type was not being
  set properly.  Thanks go to "TheR" for the spot and the fix.
* Fixed bugs in the EventLog#tail method where it would fail if the log was
  full and dups would appear.

= 0.4.1 - 28-May-2006
* Fixed a bug in the EventLog#notify_change method where the handle would
  die after five or six reads.  Thanks go to botp for the spot.

= 0.4.0 - 24-May-2006
* Now pure Ruby.
* Now includes a gemspec.
* Fixed a major bug the EventLog#tail method where it was reading the log in
  the wrong order (!!!).
* Fixed a bug in the EventLog#report_event with regards to long category_id's.
  Actually, this wasn't so much "fixed" as "avoided" by virtue of using a
  pure Ruby solution.
* Added the EventLog#full? method.
* Documentation updates and corrections, including the tutorial on creating
  and writing to your own event source.
  
== 0.3.3 - 2-Jan-2006
* If EventLog.new fails, it now raises EventLogError instead of StandardError.
* Added documentation to the eventlog.txt file for EventLog#notify_change.
* Added inline rdoc to the C source code.
* Code cleanup.

== 0.3.2 - 26-May-2005
* Code now more Unicode friendly, and other cleanup.
* Made the .txt files rdoc friendly, and removed the .rd files.
* Minor adjustments to the test suite.

== 0.3.1 - 16-Feb-2005
* Minor modifications to the source to eliminate some warnings that appeared
  in Ruby 1.8.2 or later, plus other minor tweaks.
* Renamed the sample programs and moved the 'examples' directory to the
  toplevel directory.
* Made this document rdoc friendly.

== 0.3.0 - 30-Oct-2004
* Added the notify_change() and tail() methods.
* Added the write() alias for report_event().
* The read() class and instance methods now return an array of structs if
  no block is given.
* Added the 'rubymsg.mc' message category file.  If installed, this will
  create a 'RubyMsg' event source for use with win32-service, though you
  may use it for whatever you wish.  See the README for more details. 
* Renamed struct back to EventLogStruct - sorry, sorry - I promise I won't
  change this again.
* Fixed a bug where using EventLog::SEEK_READ did not work properly (thanks
  Park).
* Added the notify.rb test script under doc/examples.

== 0.2.5 - 28-Oct-2004
* Modified the open() and read() class methods to default to "Application"
  for the default Event source.
* Removed the .html files.  You can generate these on your own with rd2.

== 0.2.4 - 19-Oct-2004
* Fixed a bug where a segfault would result if an Event Log entry were
  somehow corrupted.  Thanks go again to Joey Gibson for the spot.
* Very minor doc corrections in tutorial.txt and eventlog.txt

== 0.2.3 - 14-Oct-2004
* Fixed a bug where some Event Log descriptions were returning nil instead
  of the actual description.  Thanks go to Joey Gibson for the spot.
* Minor test suite and doc additions, including a "future plan" that may
  be of interest.

== 0.2.2 - 02-Jul-2004
* Fixed a bug in the read() method where not all the records were being
  returned.
* Fixed calls to rb_time_new() - second argument appears to be mandatory as
  of 1.8.2.
* Renamed struct returned by read() to "EventLog".
* Changed struct members "id" and "type" to "event_id" and "event_type",
  respectively.  This was to avoid any confusion with the builtin Ruby
  methods of the same name.
* Replaced STR2CSTR() with StringValuePtr(), as the former is deprecated.
  This means that as of this version, Ruby 1.8.0 or later is required.
* Moved the sample programs to doc/examples.

== 0.2.1 - 04-Mar-2004
* The add_event_source() and report_event() methods now accept symbols as
  well as do key validation.
* Moved the EventLogError class under the Win32 module.
* Normalized the tc_eventlog.rb and tc_mc.rb scripts by making it easier to
  run them standalone from another directory.
* Minor modification to the build process.
* Added a test_write.rb script for general futzing when it comes to creating
  and writing events to the log.
* Doc updates, warranty information added.

== 0.2.0 - 1-Feb-2004
* Changed the Win32EventLogError class to just EventLogError.  I felt the
  Win32 was redundant given that the class is already under the Win32 module.
* Fixed bug where bogus error messages were returned because I was calling
  GetLastError() too late.
* Fixed bug where error messages were getting cut off and/or garbled due to
  \r\n character.  (Thanks Park Heesob).
* Added open_backup class method.

== 0.1.4 - 16-Jan-2004
* Slightly better handling of the EventLog#close method.  Adopted from code
  previously submitted by Park Heesob.
* Fixed a bug in the (internal) GetUser() function that caused a segfault if
  there were 250+ records.  That function has been greatly simplified.
* Removed the rb_ensure() approach.  What I thought was a memory leak was not,
  in fact, a memory leak.  Also, it was slowing down the method considerably.
* Minor test suite update.

== 0.1.3 - 7-Jan-2004
* Fixed memory leaks in read() method (Park Heesob).
* Added read() class method (Daniel Berger).
* Test suite and doc additions & updates

== 0.1.2 - 30-Nov-2003
* Added the report_event method.  You can now write to the event log.
* Added the add_event_source class method, allowing you to register a custom
  event source.
* Added the win32-mc package to the distribution.  This is a simple
  wrapper to generate .dll files from .mc files.
* Added Event Type constants
* Test suite additions
* Documentation updates and additions, including a small tutorial.

== 0.1.1 - 5-Nov-2003
* Fixed the free() call, and added implicit eventlog closing (when the
  EventLog object is free'd).
* Simplified constants by removing 'EVENTLOG_' portion of name.
* Cleanup in the GetDescription() method, which was causing segfaults in
  conjunction with TestUnit.
* Minor doc updates and cleanup.

== 0.1.0 - 14-Oct-2003
* Initial release
