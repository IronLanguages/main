= Description
A redefinition of the File::Stat class for MS Windows.

= Prerequisites
* Ruby 1.8.2 or later.
* windows-pr 0.9.1 or later.

= Installation
rake install (non-gem) OR rake install_gem (gems)

= Synopsis
   # Don't 'require' like this in practice - see 'Known Issues' below
   require 'win32/file/stat'

   stat = File::Stat.new('file.txt')
   stat.size
   stat.readonly?
   stat.hidden?

= Differences between Ruby's File::Stat and this version:
* The File::Stat#blksize method returns a meaningful value.
* The File::Stat#blockdev method works more accurately.
* The File::Stat#blocks method returns a meaningful value.
* The File::Stat#dev method returns a drive letter, not a number.
* The File::Stat#executable? method works properly.
* The File::Stat#executable_real? returns the same value as
  File::Stat#executable? (which now works properly).
* The File::Stat#file? method works properly.
* The File::Stat#ftype method works more accurately.
* The File::Stat#pipe method works properly.
* The File::Stat#size method handles file sizes greater than 2 gigabytes
  correctly.
* The File::Stat#socket method works more accurately.
* Allows you to get file attributes specific to MS Windows, e.g. archive,
  hidden, etc.
* The inspect and pretty print output has been customized.
  
= Known issues
You should not require 'win32/file/stat' directly.  Instead, require the
win32-file library which will, in turn, require win32-file-stat.  This is
the preferred approach because some modules (i.e. 'find') use the pass-through
methods of the File class, such as File.lstat.  Many of the pass through
methods have been redefined in the win32-file library to work in conjunction
with the custom File::Stat objects created by this library.

Failure to follow these instructions could lead to cases where the core Ruby
File class attempts to use the custom File::Stat object defined in this class,
and that will likely cause problems.

= Known bugs
None that I'm aware of beyond the Known Issues listed above. Please report any
bugs you find on the project page at:

http://www.rubyforge.org/projects/win32utils.

= Miscellaneous
I had to require 'pp' explicitly in order to deal with the fact that pp.rb
has a builtin pretty_print method for File::Stat. If I didn't do this
you would end up using the pretty_print in pp.rb, which would break.

= Future Plans
This library will eventually be merged with the win32-file library.
