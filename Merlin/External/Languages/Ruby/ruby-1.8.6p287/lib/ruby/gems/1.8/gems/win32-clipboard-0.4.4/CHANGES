== 0.4.4 - 26-Aug-2008
* Some internal refactoring to ensure that the clipboard is closed on failure
  in a more robust fashion.
* Renamed the test file.
* Eliminated the custom memcpy function, since windows-pr now does the right
  thing. This necessitated bumping the minimum required windows-pr version.

== 0.4.3 - 25-Jul-2007
* Changed ClipboardError to Clipboard::Error
* Added a Rakefile with tasks for testing and installation.
* Removed the install.rb file since installation is now handled by the Rakefile.
* Updates to the README and MANIFEST.

== 0.4.2 - 27-Jan-2007
* Fixes for the clipboard_test.rb example program setup code. Thanks go to
  Harold Hausman for the spot.

== 0.4.1 - 30-Jul-2006
* Now uses the windows-pr package.  No API changes.
* Made Clipboard.get_data a true alias (instead of a facade).

== 0.4.0 - 24-Feb-2006
* Removed the C version entirely and replaced it with a pure Ruby version
  that uses the Win32API package.
* Added a gemspec.
* Added a install.rb file.

== 0.3.1 - 2-Feb-2006
* Unicode fix to handle characters with null bytes.  Thanks go to Brian
  Marick for the spot.

== 0.3.0 - 26-May-2005
* Changed the Clipboard.data= method to Clipboard.set_data because it does,
  in fact, take up to two arguments.  This API change is the main reason for
  the VERSION bump.
* Added Clipboard.get_data method as an alias for Clipboard.data.
* Removed the clipboard.rd file.  The Clipboard.txt file is now rdoc friendly.
* Now Unicode friendly.
* Added more tests, including Unicode test.
* General code cleanup.

== 0.2.1 - 28-Feb-2005
* Moved the 'examples' directory to the toplevel directory.
* Renamed the sample script to 'clipboard_test.rb'.
* Made this document and README rdoc friendly.

== 0.2.0 - 12-Jul-2004
* Made Clipboard a class instead of a module.
* Moved the ClipboardError class under the Win32 module.
* Added the formats() class method.
* Added the register_format class method.
* Added the format_available? class method.
* Added the format_name class method.
* Replaced all instances (1) of the deprecated STR2CSTR() function with the
  StringValuePtr() function.  This means that as of version 0.2.0 this package
  requires Ruby 1.8.0 or later.
* Moved the sample script to doc/examples.

== 0.1.0 - 19-Nov-2003
* Initial release
