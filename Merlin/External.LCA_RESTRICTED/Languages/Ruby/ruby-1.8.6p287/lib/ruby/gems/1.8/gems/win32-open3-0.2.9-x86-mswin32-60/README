= Description
   This library provides an Open3.popen3 implementation for MS Windows.

= Prerequisites
   Ruby 1.8.2 or later
   C++ compiler (if building from source).
   
= Installation
   rake test (optional)
   rake install (non-gem) or rake install_gem (gem)
   
= Synopsis
   require 'win32/open3'
	
   Open3.popen3('ver'){ |io_in, io_out, io_err|
      error = io_err.gets
      if error
         puts "Error: " + error.chomp
         exit
      end
      puts "Result: " + io_out.readlines.last.chomp
   }

= Notes
   This library is not supported on Windows 95, 98, or ME.
   This is a stripped down version of Park Heesob's win32_popen library.

= Developer's Notes
   This is a repackaging of Heesob's win32_popen module. The purpose of the
   repackaging was to create a unified API between the existing Ruby open3
   library and this library.

   The popen2 and posix_popen methods are not included in this release. They
   were originally part of the win32_popen module, but have been left out.
   They may be added back in at a later date.

   There are a couple of differences in the Windows version for open3 (which
   also apply to Open4.popen4) - the mode flag and the show flag.  For the
   mode, you can specify either 't' (text, the default) or 'b' (binary) as a
   second argument. For the show flag, you can specify either true or false,
   which will show the console window, or not, depending on the value you
   pass.  The default is false.

= Known Issues
   I have noticed that this library (and others) may segfault if you are using
   the latest version of the Ruby one-click installer and VC++ 7.0 or later.
   This appears to be an issue between VC++ 6 (which the installer was built
   with) and VC++ 7.0. Your best solution is to either upgrade your C
   compiler or to rebuild Ruby from scratch rather than using the installer.
   
= Precompiled binaries

   If you do a typical "gem install win32-open3" you will get a precompiled
   binary appropriate for your platform. If you want to build from source,
   go the project page and download, download the .zip file, and run the
   'install' Rake task from the command line.
   
= Future Plans
   Replace the current implementation with a pure Ruby version.
