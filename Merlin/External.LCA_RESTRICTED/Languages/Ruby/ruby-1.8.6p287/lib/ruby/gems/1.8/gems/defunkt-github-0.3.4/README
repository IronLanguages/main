The GitHub Gem
=============

This gem'll work hand-in-hand with GitHub's API to help you out.

Catch us in the #github room on freenode if you want to get involved.  Or just fork and send a pull request.

===========
Getting started
===========

  $ gem install defunkt-github -s http://gems.github.com

Run it:

  $ github <command> <args>


=============
Pulling Upstream Changes
=============

Let's say you just forked `github-gem` on GitHub from defunkt.

  $ github clone YOU/github-gem
  $ cd github-gem
  $ github pull defunkt

This will setup a remote and branch for defunkt's repository at master. 
In this case, a 'defunkt/master' branch.

If defunkt makes some changes you want, simply `github pull defunkt`.  This will
leave you in the 'defunkt/master' branch after pulling changes from defunkt's
remote.  After confirming that defunkt's changes were what you wanted, run `git
checkout master` and then `git merge defunkt/master` to merge defunkt's changes
into your own master branch.  In summary:

  $ github pull defunkt
  $ github checkout master
  $ github merge defunkt/master

If you've already reviewed defunkt's changes and just want to merge them into your 
master branch, use the `merge` flag:

  $ github pull --merge defunkt


==========
Fetching and Evaluation Downstream Changes
==========

If you are the maintainer of a project, you will often need to fetch commits
from other developers, evaluate and/or test them, then merge them into the
project.

Let's say you are 'defunkt' and 'mojombo' has forked your 'github-gem' repo,
made some changes and issues you a pull request for his 'master' branch.

From the root of the project, you can do:

  $ github fetch mojombo master
  
This will leave you in the 'mojombo/master' branch after fetching his commits.
Your local 'mojombo/master' branch is now at the exact same place as mojombo's 
'master' branch. You can now run tests or evaluate the code for awesomeness.

If mojombo's changes are good, you'll want to merge your 'master' (or another
branch) into those changes so you can retest post-integration:

  $ github merge master
  
Test/analyze again and if everything is ok:
  
  $ github checkout master
  $ github merge mojombo/master
  
The latter command will be a fast-forward merge since you already did the
real merge previously.

==========
Network Patch Queue
==========

The github gem can also show you all of the commits that exist on any fork of your
project (your network) that you don't have in your branch yet.  In order to see
the list of the projects that have commits you do not, you can run:

  $ github network list

Which will show you all the forks that have changes.  If you want to see what those
changes are, you can run:

  $ github network commits

which will show you something like this:

  9582b9 (jchris/gist)             kevin@sb.org          Add gist binary                        4 months ago

  157155 (riquedafreak/master~1)   enrique.osuna@gmail.  Updated specs.                         5 weeks ago
  f44e99 (riquedafreak/master~3)   enrique.osuna@gmail.  Only work with a clean branch.         3 months ago

These are all the commits that you don't have in your current branch that have been
pushed to other forks of your project.  If you want to incorporate them, you can use:

  $ github cherry-pick ee013a

for example to apply that single patch to your branch.  You can also merge a branch, 
if you want all the changes introduced in another branch:

  $ github merge jchris/gist

The next time you run the 'github network commits' command, you won't see any of the 
patches you have cherry-picked or merged (or rebased).  If you want to ignore a 
commit, you can simply run:
  
  $ github ignore a8c3eb

Then you won't ever see that commit again. Or, if you want to ignore a range of commits,
you can use the normal Git revision selection shorthands - for example, if you want
to ignore all 7 jchris/gist commits there, you can run:

  $ github ignore ..jchris/gist

You can also filter the output, if you want to see some subset.  You can filter by project,
author and date range, or (one of the cooler things) you can filter by whether the patch
applies cleanly to your branch head or not.  For instance, I can do this:

  $ ./bin/github network commits --applies

  ca15af (jchris/master~1)         jchris@grabb.it       fixed github gemspecs broken referen   8 weeks ago
  ee013a (luislavena/master)       luislavena@gmail.com  Replaced STDOUT by $stdout in specs.   2 weeks ago
  157155 (riquedafreak/master~1)   enrique.osuna@gmail.  Updated specs.                         5 weeks ago
  f44e99 (riquedafreak/master~3)   enrique.osuna@gmail.  Only work with a clean branch.         3 months ago

  $ ./bin/github network commits --applies --project=riq

  157155 (riquedafreak/master~1)   enrique.osuna@gmail.  Updated specs.                         5 weeks ago
  f44e99 (riquedafreak/master~3)   enrique.osuna@gmail.  Only work with a clean branch.         3 months ago

Pretty freaking sweet.  Also, you can supply the --shas option to just get a list of 
the shas instead of the pretty printout here, so you can pipe that into other 
scripts (like 'github ignore' for instance).
