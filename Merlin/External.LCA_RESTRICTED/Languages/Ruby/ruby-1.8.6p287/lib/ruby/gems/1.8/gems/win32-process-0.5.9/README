= Description
   This package provides the fork, wait, wait2, waitpid, and waitpid2 methods
   for MS Windows. In addition, it provides a different implementation of the
   kill method, and a proper implementation of the Process.ppid method.

= Prerequisites
   Ruby 1.8.2 or later.
   The 'windows-pr' library, 0.8.6 or later.
   The 'sys-proctable' library, 0.7.6 or later (test suite only).

= Supported Platforms
   This library is supported on Windows 2000 or later.

= Installation Instructions
   rake test (optional)
   rake install (non-gem) or rake install_gem (gem)

= Synopsis
   require 'win32/process'

   Process.fork{
      3.times{
         puts 'In the child'
         sleep 1
      }
   }

   Process.wait
   puts 'Done'
	
= Developer's Notes
== The Process.fork and Process.wait methods
   The fork method is emulated on Windows by spawning another Ruby process
   against $PROGRAM_NAME via the CreateProcess() Win32 API function. It will
   use its parent's environment and starting directory.
	
   The various wait methods are a wrapper for the WaitForSingleObject() or
   WaitForMultipleObjects() Win32 API functions, for the wait* and waitpid*
   methods, respectively.  In the case of wait2 and waitpid2, the exit value
   is returned via the GetExitCodeProcess() Win32API function.
	
   For now the waitpid and waitpid2 calls do not accept a second argument.
   That's because we haven't yet determined if there's a signal we should
   allow to be sent.

   IMPORTANT!	
   Note that because fork is calling CreateProcess($PROGRAM_NAME), it will
   start again from the top of the script instead of from the point of the
   call. We will try to address this in a future release, if possible.
	
== The Process.kill method
   Initially, the kill method will try to get a HANDLE on the PID using the
   OpenProcess() function. If that succeeds, we know the process is running.

   In the event of signal 2 or signal 3, the GenerateConsoleCtrlEvent()
   function is used to send a signal to that process. These will not kill
   GUI processes. It will not (currently) send a signal to remote
   processes.

   In the event of signal 1 or 4-8, the CreateRemoteThread() function is used
   after the HANDLE's process has been identified to create a thread
   within that process. The ExitProcess() function is then sent to that
   thread.

   In the event of signal 9, the TerminateProcess() function is called. This
   will almost certainly kill the process, but doesn't give the process a
   chance to necessarily do any cleanup it might otherwise do.
   
== The Process.ppid method
   In MRI the Process.ppid always returns 0 on MS Windows. With this library
   it returns the actual parent pid.

== Differences between Ruby's kill and the Win32 Utils kill
   Ruby does not currently use the CreateRemoteThread() + ExitProcess()
   approach which is, according to everything I've read, a cleaner approach.
   This includes not only online research but also Jeffrey Richter's
   "Advanced Windows Programming, 3rd Edition."
	
   Also, the way Process.kill handles multiple pids works slightly differently
   (and better IMHO) in the Win32 Utils version than the way Ruby currently
   provides.

   The reason Process.kill was originally added, in case anyone cares for
   historical trivia, is that Ruby 1.6.x did not support Process.kill on
   Windows at all.
	
== Notes
   It is unlikely you will be able to kill system processes with this module.
   It's probably better that you don't.
	
== Known Bugs	
   None known (though please see the +Details+ section for quirks).  Any
   bugs should be reported on the project page at
   http://rubyforge.org/projects/win32utils.
	
== Future Plans  
   Train Process.fork to execute from the point of the call rather than the
   top of the script (if possible).
	
   Other suggestions welcome.
