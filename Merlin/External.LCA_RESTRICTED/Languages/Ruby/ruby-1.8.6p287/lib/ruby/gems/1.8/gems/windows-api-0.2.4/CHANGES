= 0.2.4 - 18-Jul-2008
* Eliminated unnecessary LoadLibrary() attempts for functions that explicitly
  end with an 'A' or 'W', and all MSVCRT functions, since they have no 'A'
  or 'W' equivalent.
* Replaced all of the attr_reader's with a delegation scheme using Forwardable.
  All Win32::API functions now delegate to the internally stored Win32::API
  object instead of reimplementing them. This change also fixed a bug where
  the effective_function_name method did not work properly.
* Added more tests, and fixed one assertion that was wrong (the prototype).
* Some documentation additions.

= 0.2.3 - 26-Apr-2008
* Improved API.auto_constant and API.auto_method handling for functions that
  start with a lower case character or an underscore.

= 0.2.2 - 17-Apr-2008
* Added the Windows::MSVCRT_DLL constant so that users can specify MSVCRT_DLL
  for the DLL name and it will do the right thing, instead of having to worry
  about specifying a DLL or associated DLL.

= 0.2.1 - 10-Feb-2008
* Added support for long data type names, e.g. 'DWORD' instead of 'L', for
  both the prototype and return type.

= 0.2.0 - 20-Sep-2007
* Now requires the win32-api library.
* Replaced class variables with class instance variables to prevent conflicts.

= 0.1.1 - 25-May-2007
* Fixed a void parameter bug.

= 0.1.0 - 24-May-2007
* Initial release
