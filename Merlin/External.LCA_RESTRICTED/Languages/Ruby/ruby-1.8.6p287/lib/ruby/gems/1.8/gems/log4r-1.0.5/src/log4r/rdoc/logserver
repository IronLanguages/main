= Remote Logging 

Want to use Log4r over a network? No problem! A Log4r::RemoteOutputter will
send its LogEvents to a Log4r::LogServer. These two classes are as easy to
set up and use as the rest of Log4r. 

== Use ROMP

There is one catch though: ROMP is required to use this service. It is a
DRb-like system with superb performance and better features. Get ROMP at 
http://rubystuff.org/romp/

== LogServer

LogServer is simply a kind of Logger which embeds a ROMP::Server. Like a
normal Logger, you can give it Outputters, set its level and so on. Its
logging methods are accessible over a network and are called by a 
RemoteOutputter on another host.

=== LogServer Setup

Setup is easy. First,

  require 'log4r/logserver'

The following sets up a LogServer named 'central' on localhost port 9999:

  LogServer.new('central', 'tcpromp://localhost:9999')

We manipulate it and give it outputters as normal:

  serv = Logger['central']              # grab our new LogServer
  serv.add 'stdout'                     # make it log to $stdout

== RemoteOutputter

RemoteOutputter is simply a kind of Outputter that embeds a ROMP::Client. When 
RemoteOutputter gets a LogEvent, it will forward it to whatever LogServer it's 
connected to. In essence, RemoteOutputter behaves like a Logger that is
forwarding a LogEvent to another Logger (as is done in heiarchial logging).

=== RemoteOutputter Setup

First,

  require 'log4r/outputter/remoteoutputter'

Unlike typical outputters, RemoteOutputter doesn't do any formatting. That's
up to the LogServer's outputters. Otherwise, RemoteOutputter can be
set up as usual. The ROMP uri of the LogServer must be specified.

  RemoteOutputter.new 'client', :uri=>'tcpromp://localhost:9999'

=== Using RemoteOutputter

Give our new RemoteOutputter to a logger:

  mylog = Logger['mylog']
  mylog.add 'client'

Now, whenever mylog generates a LogEvent, LogServer should get a copy. Doing
the following:

  mylog.info "This is a message from 'mylog'"

Produces this output on LogServer's console:

  INFO mylog: This is a message from 'mylog'

== XML Configuration

RemoteOutputter is set up like normal Outputters. LogServer is set up
like a normal Logger, but with an element name of logserver instead of
logger:

  <log4r_config>
    <logserver name="name" uri="tcpromp://localhost:9999">
    ...

== Debugging

It is recommended to set up a logger named 'log4r' on both the server and
client to see what LogServer and RemoteOutputter are up to. Both of the classes
use Log4r's internal logging to report any problems. See the section
<b>What's Going on Inside?</b> in log4r.rb for more info.
