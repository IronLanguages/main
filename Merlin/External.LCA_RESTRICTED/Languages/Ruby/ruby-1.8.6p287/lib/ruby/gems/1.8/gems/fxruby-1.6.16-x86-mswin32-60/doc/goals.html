    interface to <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="http://www.fox-toolkit.com" target="_top">FOX</a> from
    <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="http://www.ruby-lang.org" target="_top">Ruby</a>. Ruby programs should
    be able to access FOX classes transparently; this includes deriving new
    Ruby classes from FOX classes and overriding their virtual functions. This
    goal has been met pretty well at this point although there are undoubtedly
    a number of bugs waiting to be discovered.</p><p>A secondary goal of the project is to promote Ruby and FOX, two great
    open-source projects that both deserve wider recognition. After discovering
    Ruby and monitoring the comp.lang.ruby newsgroup postings for only a few
    weeks, it became apparent that users were dissatisfied with the existing
    GUI options for Ruby. As with Python, Tk is the de facto standard because
    of its maturity and availability on a number of platforms (including the
    Macintosh). But Tk is also showing its age in many ways and it has failed
    to keep pace with some of the "younger" cross-platform GUI toolkits like
    FOX, wxWidgets, FLTK, Qt and GTK+. Of the latter five, only Qt and GTK+
    appeared (at the time) to have usable Ruby interfaces and there are some
    problems associated with these as well; for Qt, it's the restrictive
    license for the Windows platform version, and for GTK+ it's a Windows
    version that often lags far behind the standard Linux/Unix version. There
    is clearly a need for a modern, open-source, cross-platform GUI for Ruby,
    and FOX fills that need.</p><p>Since its first public release in January 2001, FXRuby has become one
    of the most popular GUI options for Ruby:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>In a <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="http://www.rubygarden.org/pollBooth.php?op=results&amp;pollID=4" target="_top">

      Conference in Tampa, Florida.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Although the lack of documentation has been a sore spot for
      some time, several Ruby books (such as the <em class="citetitle">
      Ruby Developer's Guide</em> and <em class="citetitle">The Ruby
      Way</em>) feature FXRuby as a Ruby GUI development option.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>FXRuby is used as the GUI for <a xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" href="http://freeride.rubyforge.org/wiki/wiki.pl" target="_top">
    FreeRIDE</a> and a number of other Ruby-based projects.</p></li></ul></div><p>Most recently, work has focused on keeping FXRuby up-to-date with the
    still evolving FOX library while looking for new ways to make Ruby GUI
    development fun. If you have suggestions about where you'd like to
