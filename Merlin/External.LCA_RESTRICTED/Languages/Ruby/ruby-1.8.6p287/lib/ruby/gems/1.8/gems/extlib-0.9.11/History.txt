=== 0.9.11 / not released

  * No changes this version

=== 0.9.10 / 2009-01-19

* 1 major enhancement:

  * Ruby 1.9.1 compatibility

* 1 minor enhancement:

  * Updated LazyArray#eql? and LazyArray#== to compare without lazy
    loading if possible.

3 bug fixes:

  * Fix for inheritance and hooks
  * Fix for Class inheritable accessor to use #try_dup
  * Fix for LazyArray to be more explicit in delegating to Array,
    to lessen conflicts in subclasses

=== 0.9.9 / 2008-12-07

* 1 major enhancement:

  * Updated LazyArray to have a tail/head so that it can append/prepend
    without lazy-loading.  This will eliminate some too-eager loading
    from DataMapper::Collection, and (in certain cases) will boost
    performance significantly.

* 3 minor enhancements:

  * Minor Ruby 1.9.1 fixes.  RSpec still needs to be updated to support
    1.9.1 before everything can be verified completely.
  * Updated Extlib::Inflection so that the plural of "cow" is now
    "cows" instead of "kine".
  * Misc documentation updates.

* 2 bug fixes:

  * Fixed Extlib::Pooling Threading issue on JRuby and Windows.
  * Removed Object#encoded_hash.  It was not used by DataMapper or Merb,
    and the specs were failing for JRuby.
