= Notes about the test suite
For all the unit tests to pass, the 'sometestfile.txt' file must have the
'archive' and 'readonly' attributes set.  Although I have them set on the
file when I create the zip archive, it seems that file attributes aren't
guaranteed to survive the process. 

So, please change the file attributes manually if needed before running the
test suite.  You can do this by right-clicking on the file in Explorer and
selecting 'properties'.  The readonly attribute check-box is at the bottom
left corner.  To get to the archive attribute click on the 'Advanced' tab.
You should see a checkbox at the top.

= Known issues or bugs
None that I'm aware of. Please report any bugs you find on the project page
