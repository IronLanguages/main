= Information about Message Files
Each event source should register message files that contain description
strings for each event identifier, event category, and parameter. Register
these files in the EventMessageFile, CategoryMessageFile, and
ParameterMessageFile registry values for the event source.

You can create one message file that contains descriptions for the event
identifiers, categories, and parameters, or create three separate message
files. Several applications can share the same message file.

You should typically create message files as resource-only DLLs. They are
smaller and faster than ordinary DLLs.

= What does a .mc file look like?

A .mc file is just a plain text file that is parsed by the "mc" utility to
generate a header and, ultimately, a .dll file.  Here is a quick sample.
Note that there must be a newline after the last '.' at the bottom.
The ';' character denotes a comment.

; foo.mc
MessageId=0x1
SymbolicName=CATEGORY_ERROR
Language=English
error
.

MessageId=0x2
SymbolicName=CATEGORY_WARNING
Language=English
warning
.

MessageId=0x3
Severity=Error
SymbolicName=FOO_ERROR
Language=English
Error: %1
.

= How to generate a .dll file from a .mc file
To turn this file into a .dll you have two options.  The first is to use the
command line utilities.  Follow these steps:

1) mc filename.mc
2) rc -r -fo filename.res filename.rc
3) link -dll -noentry -out:filename.dll filename.res

Your other option is to use the win32-mc library, which is a simple wrapper
for the above commands, and is included with this library.  You now have a
dll that you can associate with your event source (i.e. the one you associate
with your application).  You can also take a look at the C header file that
.mc generates and use that in your own extensions if you like.

After this you'll need to register your event source and associate the .dll
file with it.  To do that, use the EventLog.add_event_source method. Be sure
to specify the number of categories manually - it is not calculated
automatically by the OS.

Returning to the .mc file, the example I used actually creates two categories,
"error" and "warning", and one event message.  The numbers you assign here
create corresponding (though not identical) values in the header file that
is generated. It is the values found in the header file that you pass to the
EventLog#report_event method for the category or event id.  Here's the
relevant data from the foo.h file (using foo.mc above):

#define CATEGORY_ERROR 0x00000001L
#define CATEGORY_WARNING 0x00000002L
#define FOO_ERROR 0xC0000003L

In the case of categories, that number is the name number that shows up in the
"category" field in the Event Viewer.  In the case of event message files, it
is the text that shows up in the event description.

The "data" field is what replaces "%1" as an actual text string in the event
log, sort of like a printf format specifier, except that it's always a string.

= Registering an event source
First, create the .dll file from the .mc file. Then register that .dll file
for an event source we'll call "foo". You can name the .dll file anything
you like, but for sanity's sake I recommend keeping the same as the event
source name.

require 'win32/eventlog'
include Win32

dll_file = 'c:\\wherever\\foo.dll'

EventLog.add_event_source(
   :source                => 'Application',
   :key_name              => 'foo',
   :category_count        => 2,
   :event_message_file    => dll_file,
   :category_message_file => dll_file
)

After you run this, you can run 'regedit' and see that your event source has
been inserted into the registry. You can find it under:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EventLog\Application.

= Writing to the event source
Now that our event source 'foo' is registered, we can begin writing event
log data for it.  Here's an example of how you use it:

require 'win32/eventlog'
include Win32

EventLog.open('Application') do |log|
   log.report_event(
      :source     => 'foo',
      :event_type => EventLog::WARN,
      :category   => '0x00000002L'.hex,
      :event_id   => '0x00000003L'.hex,
      :data       => 'I'm warning you!'
   )
end

Note the values used for the 'category' and 'event_id' keys.  Those are the
values that were generated automatically in the foo.h file that I showed you
above.  You'll have to manually inspect the header file that's generated to
determine which values you should be using.

You can now open your event log viewer and look at the message.  You can get
to your event log viewer via Start -> Control Panel -> Administrative Tools ->
Event Viewer.  You should see a warning message with the category "warning"
and an event id of '3'.  If you right click on that entry and select
"properties", you can see the event description is "Warning: I'm warning you!".
