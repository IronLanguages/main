== 1.6.2 - 4-Aug-2009
* Now compatible with Ruby 1.9.x.
* License changed to Artistic 2.0.
* Added the Pathname.pwd method as a synonym for Pathname.new(Dir.pwd).
* Modified Pathname#dirname so that you can specify a level that indicates
  how many levels up you want to retrieve. For example, if your path was
  '/usr/local/bin', then path.dirname(2) would return '/usr'.
* Now compatible with Ruby 1.9.x.
* Bumped required version of the facade library to 1.0.4.

== 1.6.1 - 8-Nov-2008
* Added the Pathname#[] method, which accepts an index, an index plus a
  length, or a range, and returns appropriate the path element(s).
* Refactoring the platform checking in the test suite to use rbconfig instead
  of RUBY_PLATFORM.
* More inline documentation examples.

== 1.6.0 - 13-July-2008
* The facade for ftools (and ftools itself) has been removed. The ftools
  library is deprecated in favor of FileUtils.
* PathnameError is now Pathname::Error.
* Bug fix for Pathname#relative_path_from for MS Windows. Thanks go to an
  anonymous user for the spot.
* Fixed a bug where frozen strings would raise an error on MS Windows.
* The code is now -w clean.
* Removed the C version as part of the release because it was just too
  difficult to maintain both versions. The C code remains in CVS, however.
* Changed platform checking to use rbconfig instead of RUBY_PLATFORM to avoid
  potential issues with other Ruby implementation.

== 1.5.2 - 9-Mar-2007
* Bug fix for the Pathname#realpath method where it was not handling recursive
  symlinks. The C version was also fixed, but it only affected platforms that
  don't have the realpath() function.
* Added a test for recursive symlinks (for Solaris, anyway).
* Updated the docs for Pathname#realpath.
* Minor speed enhancements for the C version and the elimination of one
  (potential) segfault.
* Added a 'Future Plans' section to the README.
* Added a Rakefile. You can now build, clean, and test and install (both the
  pure Ruby and C versions).

== 1.5.1 - 28-Aug-2006
* Added the Kernel#pn method as a shortcut for Pathname.new.
* The Pathname#readlink now properly handles symbolic links.  The 'fix'
  from 1.4.4 did not work.
* The C extension uses your system's realpath() function for the
  Pathname#readlink method if it has one.
* Added the '/' alias for '+'.  So, p1 / p2 is the same as p1 + p2.
* The windows-pr package is now required on MS Windows.

== 1.5.0 - 17-Apr-2006
* Better subclass handling, in that some methods that previously returned
  hardcoded Pathname.new now return self.class.new.
* File URL's are now handled on Unix as well (using the 'uri' package).
* Some comment changes/clarifications.
* Added the PathnameError class to the pure Ruby version.

== 1.4.4 - 23-Mar-2006
* If the path is a symbolic link the Pathname#realpath method
  now returns the absolute path of that link, i.e. the result
  of File.readlink (as a Pathname object).

== 1.4.3 - 3-Mar-2006
* Added the Pathname#realpath method.

== 1.4.2 - 22-Feb-2006
* Fixed the Pathname#relative_path_from method for Windows.  This really only
  affected edge cases that you probably never saw anyway.
* Added corresponding tests for Windows.

== 1.4.1 - 18-Feb-2006
* Added the Pathname#parent method.
* Added the Pathname#relative_path_from method.
* Bug fix for Pathname#pstrip on *nix.
* Corresponding test suite additions.

== 1.4.0 - 19-Dec-2005
* Added destructive and non-destructive methods for some methods - pstrip,
  pstrip!, undecorate, undecorate!, clean and clean!.
* Added a C extension version of this package.  You can use the C version
  instead of the pure Ruby version instead.  See the README for more details.
* Fixed bug in the root method where the result wasn't guaranteed to be a
  Pathname class.
* Fixed bugs in Windows version where the receiver was inadvertantly modified
  in some cases, and added tests to check for this in the future.
* Modified the Dir.glob facade so that it (temporarily) changes to the path
  directory, globs on that path, then returns to the original directory.
* Added the bench_pathname.rb script to let you benchmark all Pathname
  methods.

== 1.3.1 - 21-Nov-2005
* Added the Pathname#children method.
* Added tests for the Pathname#children method.

== 1.3.0 - 28-Oct-2005
* Added the short_path and long_path methods for MS Windows.
* Optimization for the '+' method on Unix.
* Added some examples under the 'examples' directory.
* More tests added and some minor changes to the test suite in general.

== 1.2.1 - 1-Sep-2005
* Bug fix for the ascend and descend methods wrt Windows and UNC paths.
* More tests added for ascend and descend methods.

== 1.2.0 - 29-Aug-2005
* Added the 'ascend' and 'descend' methods.
* Added corresponding test suite additions.

== 1.1.0 - 13-Jul-2005
* Added the 'find' facade.

== 1.0.0 - 11-Jun-2005
* Initial release
