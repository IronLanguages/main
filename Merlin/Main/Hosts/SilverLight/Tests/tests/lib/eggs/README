= Eggs
by Jimmy Schementi

A Silverlight behavior testing library (using IronRuby and Bacon)

== Dependencies

Make sure to run "git submodule init" and "git submodule update" to get
any dependencies.

bacon: a small RSpec clone
http://github.com/jschementi/bacon

== Sample

The sample depends on AgDLR:
git clone git://github.com/jschementi/agdlr.git

Clone it so agdlr and eggs are siblings. After doing a build of AgDLR, 
from their parent director, run:

agdlr\script\server /b:eggs/sample/index.html

You're default browser will open, and you should see the following:

rb> Eggs.current.run_tests
Sample bacon test
- should be true

1 specifications (1 requirements), 0 failures, 0 errors
=> nil

== Usage

From a IronRuby silverlight application:

  require 'eggs'

  # Tell eggs your test sets, and each test name in those sets
  Eggs.config(
    :test_set => %W(
      console
      dynamic_application
      extension_types
      package
      window
    ),
    :another_test_set => %W(
      args
      auto_addref
      error_handle
      execfile
      issubclass
    )
  )

  # Do you like bacon with your eggs? I hope so ...
  # Runs the tests with bacon
  Eggs.run

From a C# silverlight application

  // 1. Place eggs.xap in the same location as the XAP file of the app you are
  //    testing, for convenience. It could be different, but then the code below 
  //    would need to change

  // 2. Create a "tests" directory in your Silverlight application, and add your
  //    tests in that directory. The files should be added to the project, and marked
  //    as "Content" so they are included in the application's XAP.

  // 3. In your Application_Startup handler, start the download of eggs.xap  

    if (HtmlPage.Document.QueryString.ContainsKey("test")) {
        var xap = new Uri("eggs.xap", UriKind.Relative);
        WebClient wcXap = new WebClient();
        wcXap.OpenReadCompleted += new OpenReadCompletedEventHandler(wcXap_OnOpenReadCompleted);
        wcXap.OpenReadAsync(xap);
    }
    
  // 4. Define the callback to be fired when the download is complete.
  //    This will define the test list, load Eggs.dll, and run the tests

    private void wcXap_OnOpenReadCompleted(object sender, OpenReadCompletedEventArgs e) {
        if ((e.Error == null) && (e.Cancelled == false)) {
            var testList = new Dictionary<string, List<string>>() {
                {"tests", new List<string>() { "sample" }}
            };

            var xap = new StreamResourceInfo(e.Result, null);
            System.Reflection.Assembly asm = new AssemblyPart().Load(
                Application.GetResourceStream(
                    xap, new Uri("Eggs.dll", UriKind.Relative)
                ).Stream
            );
            asm.GetType("Eggs").GetMethod("Start").Invoke(null, new object[] {
                (object) testList, (object) xap
            });
        }
    }
