ironruby-0.9.0.0 - 2009-07-30
-----------------------------

	Date: Wednesday, July 29, 2009 4:56:49 PM
		(sborde) Tweaks IPy tutorial now that the MSI includes the Python standard library.
		I had changed Ruby’s dev.bat to not set HOME since ir.exe itself now sets it.
		However, HOME is needed by the rest of dev.bat to copy the .mspecrc file. 
		So added that code back using the name HOME_FOR_MSPECRC.
		TypeLibs were not exposing aliased types. There are important enums that are
		declared as aliases. I noticed this when adding WIN32OLE support in IronRuby.

		(tomat) (MiscConversions)
		
		DLR:
		Fixes ReflectionUtils.FormatTypeName so that it formats generic type 
		definitions as C# does – using empty type names: C<,> instead of C<K,V>.
		
		Ruby:
		1) A Ruby class corresponding to a CLR generic type definition is now a 
		   super-class of all instantiations of that type. So for example, List<> is
		   a super-class of List<int>, List<string>, etc. Similarly all
		   instantiations of a generic interface include the module that corresponds
		   to their generic interface definition. This allows to add methods to the
		   generic definition and call them from any instantiation. For example, 
		
			include System::Collections::Generic
		
			class List
			  def foo
			    p self.class
			  end
			end
		
		List.of(Fixnum).new.foo   # => System::Collections::Generic::List[Fixnum]
		List.of(String).new.foo   # => System::Collections::Generic::List[String]
		
		2) Implements TypeGroup#[] overload taking a Fixnum. This is useful when one 
		   needs to select a generic type definition out of a group of types. For example, 
			 given three classes C:
		
			public class C {
			  public virtual int Arity { get { return 0; } }
			}
			public class C<T> {
			  public virtual int Arity { get { return 1; } }
			}
			public class C<T,S> {
			  public virtual int Arity { get { return 2; } }
			}
		
			p C[0]  # => C
			p C[1]  # => C[T]
			p C[2]  # => C[T, S]
		
		Note that the resulting classes are not generic instantiations – they are still 
		generic definitions and need to be instantiated.
		
		3) Maps [] and []= on CLR arrays to Get/Set methods. This enables to apply Ruby 
		conversions on array elements assignment.
		Changes CLR array factories so that they perform conversions of elements like so:
		
			class C
			  def to_str; 'c';  end
			end
		
			System::Array[System::String].new(3, C.new)      # => [‘c’, ‘c’, ‘c’]
			System::Array[String].new([C.new, C.new])        # => [“c”, “c”, “c”]
			System::Array[System::Byte].new(3) { |x| x + 1 } # => [1 (Byte), 2 (Byte), 3 (Byte)]
		
	Date: Wednesday, July 29, 2009 2:51:30 PM
		(tomat) Updates ToolsVersion of IronPython and IronRuby projects to 4.0.
	
	Date: Monday, July 27, 2009 6:59:09 PM
		(tomat) Adds IConvertibleMetaObject interfaces to DLR so that binders can query 
		meta-objects on their convertibility to given types.
		Implements this interface for MetaPythonFunction.
		Adds DynamicMetaObject fromArg parameter to OverloadResolver.CanConvertFrom. This 
		allows to check if the argument is convertible to certain types via 
		IConvertibleMetaObject interface.
		
		Slightly improves overload resolution:
		
		Overload resolution first tries to convert arguments to parameter types on 
		increasing narrowing levels. On each level only the overloads whose parameters 
		are convertible from the actual arguments are further considered. Pairs of 
		corresponding parameters are ordered based upon convertibility of their types 
		to each other. If the parameter types are unordered (one cannot be converted 
		to the other and vice versa) the resolution goes on and tries to choose the 
		overload based on other traits of the methods (like generic parameters etc.).
		When comparing parameters the actual type of the argument is not considered. 
		Therefore the following method call (in Python) is considered ambiguous. There
		is no ordering of the types of the first parameters (int and D types), which
		would prefer one or the other.
		
		Adds IConvertibleMetaObject interfaces to DLR so that binders can query
		meta-objects on their convertibility to given types.
		Implements this interface for MetaPythonFunction.
		Adds DynamicMetaObject fromArg parameter to OverloadResolver.CanConvertFrom. 
		This allows to check if the argument is convertible to certain types via
		IConvertibleMetaObject interface.

	Date: Monday, July 27, 2009 12:10:11 PM
		(jdeville) Bug closing:
		YAML does not properly deserialize Time values
		overriding unsafe methods
		Better error message for running ir.exe on pre-.Net 2.0 SP1
		rand doesn't work collectly
		Rubygems failures
		Adding a random object to Time which responds to to_f
		ArgumentError when calling System.String..ctor(Char[], int, int)
		Unverifiable code generated by mspec :lang
		-X:PrivateBinding does not enable referring to classes that have 
		internal visibility
		
		Notes on these:
		 * To get better error messages on pre-.NET 2.0sp1, I moved the error 
		   checking code from PythonConsoleHost up to ConsoleHost
		 * As part of writing name_mangling specs, I created stubs for all of 
		   the IronRuby module. I'll start filling those specs out going forward.
		 
	Date: Monday, July 27, 2009 12:05:25 AM
		(tomat) Disallows mangling of initialize method.
	
	Date: Sunday, July 26, 2009 10:44:47 PM
		(tomat) Makes to_s override to_string and ToString methods.
		Fixes bug:
		- If a CLR class has Initialize method its Ruby subclasses called it when instantiated.

	Author: Shri Borde <sborde@microsoft.com>
	Date:   Thu Jul 23 14:22:15 2009 -0700

		Fixes HTTP.post_form (http://ironruby.codeplex.com/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=1353). 
		Socket#write was not flushing the data, and so a later read could block since the
		endpoint would not send any response

	Date: Thursday, July 23, 2009 11:07:06 AM
		(tomat)   Implements basic debug views for classes that implement IRubyObject.
		

	Date: Thursday, July 23, 2009 10:23:09 AM
		(tomat) The long term goal is to allow Scopes to be backed by arbitrary objects and 
		implement GetVariable/SetVariable/… via dynamic GetMember/SetMember/… actions. This
		will also allow languages to cache lookups to the scopes. 
		
		The first step is to move Python specific stuff off the Scope and LanguageContext.
		
		Breaking changes in Hosting API:
		- ScriptScope.GetVariable throws MissingMemberException if a variable is not found 
		  in the scope instead of a language specific exception (like Python’s UnboundNameException).
		- ScriptScope.GetVariable doesn’t return variables that are not contained in the scope 
		  itself. Previously it returned e.g. Python built-ins (like “dir”) if the scope was 
		  associated with Python.
		- ScriptScope.RemoveVariable doesn’t throw an exception if the member is not present. 
		  It returns false.
		
	Date: Wednesday, July 22, 2009 10:43:09 AM
		(tomat) Disallows interop calls to Ruby non-public methods.
	

	Date: Tuesday, July 21, 2009 9:49:14 AM
		(dinov) Moves CodeContext up into IronPython.
		
		Wherever we had CodeContext before or an Expression for flowing CodeContext it’s
		been replaced w/ a OverloadResolverFactory instead.
		There’s lots of now we flow full MetaObjects instead of just flowing Expressions 
		through in the DLR binding (more cleanup could be done here in the future)
		Added IPythonMembersList which takes CodeContext, made IMembersList not take it.
		Removed some dead code related to old-style DLR binders
		
		Also fixing 20262 - quoting in MSBuild files
		codeplexcomment
		
	Date: Monday, July 20, 2009 5:32:44 PM
		(tomat) Replaces IronRuby.Tests.VS by ircoverage.bat that gathers the code coverage data 
		for IronRuby.Tests.exe.
		
	Date: Monday, July 20, 2009 4:53:53 PM
		(tomat) DLR changes:
		Makes ReadOnlyDictionary and SynchronizedDistionary public.
		
		Ruby changes:
		
		Provides API for accessing DLR Scopes created by importing files of other DLR languages. 
		
		IronRuby#require(path), load(path)
		- These have the same semantics as Kernel#require and Kernel#load except for they execute
		  given script against a new Scope and it. If the target is an assembly they return the
		  loaded assembly.
		IronRuby#loaded_scripts 
		- Returns a dictionary that holds on loaded scripts and their Scopes.
		IronRuby#loaded_assemblies
		- Returns an array of assemblies loaded to the current runtime.
		IronRuby#globals
		- Returns the current ScriptRuntime.Globals scope.
		
		This allows to easily import e.g. IronPython files and work with the modules they define:

		a.py:
			Foo = 1
			
			class Bar(object):
			  def baz(self):
			  print Foo
		
		b.rb:
			a = IronRuby.require('a')   # a is an instance of Scope
			a.foo += 1                  # get and set Python module variable 
			a.bar.new.baz               # instantiate Python class and call its instance method
		
		Also includes “mangling” shelveset.

		- Bignum related fixes:
			o Changed the signature for ClrBigInteger.ToString(self,radix), now 
			  Bignum#to_s works as expected raising an ArgumentException if base 
			  is less than 2 or higher than 36.
			o Fixed Bignum#divmod, Bignum#remainder, Bignum#% and Bignum#modulo 
			  to work with Float values as argument.
			o Fixed Bignum#/ and Bignum#div as they behave differently with each
			  other when Float values are passed as argument.

	Date:   Sat Jul 18 16:26:05 2009 +0200

		- Array related fixes:
			o Array#== does not call #to_ary on its argument but it calls #to_a (it 
			  basically performs a conversion of the argument rather than casting it
			  to a ruby array)
			o Array#zip calls #to_ary to cast the argument to an Array, therefore it
			  overrides Enumerable#zip in which the argument is converted by calling #to_a.

			o Implemented 'Q' and 'q' directives

	Date: Friday, July 17, 2009 12:11:49 PM
		(tomat) Removes IronRuby.Libraries.Scanner - it's not used.
		Adds ConsoleAny project as a copy of Ruby.Console except for that it
		produces assembly ir64.exe.
		Changes Ruby.Console to build with x86 platform flag so that ir.exe
		starts in a 32bit process on 64bit OS.

		Moves setting of %HOME% from IronRuby.Libraries.dll to ir.exe. This is ruby.exe
		feature, not necessarily a language feature, and setting of environment variables
		should be something that the host controls.
		Moved the ExpandPath logic to RubyUtils, and also made it work with System.String
	  	instead of MutableString

		Adds support for ENV['HOME'] by setting the HOME environment variable on startup. 
		I have confirmed that MRI does actually set the process environment variable
		(and not just some value on a Ruby object)
		Modifies the algorithm to calculate the value to set for HOME so that it passes 
		the new tests
		KernelOps.GetShell had to be modified to be able to span processes even after 
		doing ENV.clear (like MRI)
		Removes logic to calculate HOME from dev.bat

		- Convert return values from DBNull to nil, from System::Decimal to String
		Also, removes support for indexed property syntax like excel.Workbooks[1].

		- various tweaks to get SL working -- but doesn't have rich text yet
		- adds erb.rb and stringio.rb to Libs so SL can get them.
		- Tweak Chiron so it won't copy to test dir if not present
		- Tweak to RubyEncoding to utf-8 works in SL

		(jdeville) Files related to the git automation and getting rake compile working
		again.

	Date: Wednesday, July 15, 2009 4:15:48 PM
		(tomat) Virtual methods that have been detached from the CLR type and redefined
		on the corresponding Ruby class or its subclass should not directly invoked from
		a dynamic virtual call since that leads to an infinite recursion. 
		
		Example:
		 class C < ArrayList           
		   define_method(:Add, instance_method(:Add))          
		 end
		 
		 C.new.Add(1)
		 
		C.new.Add dispatches to the virtual ArrayList::Add, which in turn dispatches to 
		the auto-generated override C$1::Add. If we called the resolved method directly
		from the dynamic virtual call rule it would invoke the C$1::Add override again
		leading to a stack overflow. So we need to use a base call instead.

		(tomat)   DLR:

		Ruby:
			Implements Kernel#rand, Kernel#srand. 
			Improves scope allocation perf.

	Date: Monday, July 13, 2009 5:10:48 PM
		(tomat) DLR:
		Implements interpretation of coalescing expression.
			
		Ruby:
			Reuses delegates created for blocks. BlockDispatcher is baked into the lambda
			as a runtime constant with initially uninitialized target delegate. This
			delegate is initialized first time the block is defined and then reused
			next time. This makes nested block loops much faster as it avoids unnecessary
			calls to DynamicMethod.CreateDelegate.
		
			Uses MutableTuple for local variable storage instead of StrongBox<object>[]. 
			Fixes a bug in state variable allocation for flip-flop operator.

		(tomat) DLR:
		- Renames CollectionUtils.Sort to ToSortedList to avoid collisions with Sort
		  methods on classes implementing ICollection.
		- Adds helper that converts delegate Comparion<T> to IComparable.
		
		Ruby:
		
		Improves implementation of RubyArray. So for example a loop doing Array#shift is
		not shifting the entire array content left every iteration. 
		
		Also adds MsTest.cs stub to IronRuby.Tests so that we can easily get code coverage
		numbers for unit tests in VS. This depends on
		Microsoft.VisualStudio.QualityTools.UnitTestFramework assembly that is not
		available on Mono so our rake build removes this file from build.

		(jomes) Improves the ExpressionVisitor API (720267):
		
		- Expression.Accept is protected.
		
		- Expression.VisitChildren takes an ExpressionVisitor.
		
		- ExpressionVisitor helpers are public:
			o Visit(ReadOnlyCollection<Expression>)
			o Visit<T>(ReadOnlyCollection<T>, Func<T, T>)
			o VisitAndConvert<T>(T, string)
			o VisitAndConvert<T>(ReadOnlyCollection<T>, string)
		
		- All nodes with children have an Update method that replaces the children
			o Returns the same node if none of the children changed
			o Most Update methods are tested already by the visitor
			o Added tests for those that were not: Block, Dynamic, Invocation, MethodCall, Index

		Converts COM interop tests to using win32ole. Hardly any changes were required! 
		The only change required is that win32ole requires using parenthesis to access
		indexed properties, but the tests used square brackets. For now, I have added
		support to win32ole for square brackets instead of modifying the tests. Also,
		WIN32OLE_EVENT does not seem to have any way of unsubscribing from an event.
		adodb_spec has a weird failure only with non-managled names, and so I have left
		it using Type.GetTypeFromProgID for now

	Date:   Thu Jul 9 10:18:15 2009 -0700

		Basic implementation of win32ole, building on top of IronRubyâ€™s COM interop support.
		Simple samples work reasonably work. Features that work are:
			* Object instantiation with WIN32OLE.new
			* Calling methods, accessing properties
			* Converting Ruby type arguments (ie. String, Array, etc) to 
			  System.String, System.Array, etc
			* Enumeration via WIN32OLE#each
			* Accessing enum values from the type library via WIN32OLE.const_load
			
		Events (WIN32OLE_EVENT) are not supported since IronRuby does not support COM events yet.
		Also, this TODO from win32ole.rb :
		# TODO - Instead of wrapping the RCWs (runtime-callable-wrapper), we should just
		# return them directly (and make WIN32OLE an alias for System.__ComObject). We currently
		# wrap them so that we can cheaply customize the behavior of the resulting object
		# (for eg, to convert the arguments).
		# However, all the customizations should be moved into the IronRuby runtime
		# itself and made to work directly against RCWs. This will allow better cross-language
		# inteorp of passing RCW arguments, better perf since it will avail of call-site
		# caching, and object identity.

		(tomat) Perf improvements of misc String operations:
		- MutableString no longer tracks its version. It was only used to detect changes made
		  to the string. The same is possible by checking for “HasChanged” flag which is set 
		  by every mutating operation. 
		- Reimplements “tr”, “tr!”, “tr_s”, “tr_s!”. The new implementation is almost 12x faster.
		- Reimplements “join” to achieve better perf.
		
		Improves handling of KCoding – combination of two strings k-coded by a different 
		encoding doesn’t result to an error but to a binary encoded string. The string
		loses its encoded appearance and it behaves like raw binary data to .NET programs.

		(tomat) Replaces DLR closures by a Ruby specific implementation. This will allow us

		Module#autoload call should be ignored if the constant is defined. Without 
		this, a class definition was being lost if autoload was called after the 
		class definition was executed
		(timeObj == "string") should return nil. It was throwing TypeError because
		method overload resolution was finding System.DateTime.op_Equality. Throwing
		a TypeError is ok for .NET types with strongly typed op_Equality, but not
		for those types that represent Ruby types.

		Time yaml strings

		IronRuby Tutorial polish:
			- Starting a tutorial jumps directly to the first task, but shows section
			  and chapter introductions above it (if they exist).
			- FrameworkElement#set_or_collapse didn't show the element
			- select_tree_view_item should only be used if the TreeView was 
			  constructed with code
			- "Move to next chapter" button is auto-focused
			- Always scroll to the bottom on any repl activity
			- Increase default window size to 640x700
			- Header now has a bottom shadow instead of a border, to make scrolling
			  text look cleaner.
			- Section/Chapter navigation now fills vertical space, and is a 100px wider.
			- No more tutorial introduction animation; it always shows on the first page.

		Fixes implementation of Kernel#eql?, Kernel#==, Kernel#hash, Array#eql? and
		Array#hash and improves CLR interop. 
		Improves performance of Array#- from quadratic algorithm to linear.

		CLR interop:
		“hash” is mapped to “GetHashCode” and following below rules:
		1)	A Ruby call to Kernel#hash on a CLR object that overrides GetHashCode 
		    will call that override.
		2)	A Ruby call to Kernel#hash on a Ruby subclass of a CLR type will call
		    the GetHashCode of the CLR type if the Ruby subclass doesn’t implement
				“hash” method.
		3)	A Ruby data structure (like Array) that calculates its hash code based
		    on hash codes of its items dynamically calls “hash” on those items.
		4)	Any call from C# to GetHashCode on an instance of any Ruby class will
		    dynamically dispatch to either “hash”, “GetHashCode” or “get_hash_code”
				whichever is found first in standard method resolution order. If multiple 
				of these methods are defined in the same class “hash” has highest priority
				and “get_hash_code” the lowest. This implies that a Ruby method definition
				with name “hash”, “GetHashCode” or “get_hash_code” in any Ruby class 
				overrides GetHashCode of the parent CLR class. 

		Similarly is “eql?” mapped to “Equals”.

		Kernel#== is an alias for “eql?” and hence has the same behavior when invoked. 
		However, 4) doesn’t hold for “==”, i.e. method == defined in a Ruby class does
		NOT override CLR Equals method. 

		Adds /noadaptive option to unit test driver.
		Fixes removal of CLR methods.

		Simplifies implementation of IsRemovable on RubyMemberInfo using IsRubyMethod. 
		IsRubyMethod returns true on all members that were defined by Ruby means, be
		it explicit method definition (def keyword), alias, alias_method, define_method,
		public/private/protected, overload, of, etc. CLR members used for definition of
		a new method (via define_method, alias etc.) are called “detached” (as opposed
		to “attached” CLR members, which represent the original CLR members). They
		behave like any Ruby method with respect to method removal.

		DLR: Fixes bugs and implements new features in interpreter.
		-	Static field assignment.
		-	LessThan
		-	ConvertUnary – should re-box numeric values.
		-	Force compilation whenever ref/out parameters are encountered.
		-	Invocation expression with delegate target.
		-	Unbox – no-op.
		-	TypeEqual and TypeIs for sealed types.

		Ruby:
		-	Implements adaptively compiled rules:
		-	RubyMetaBinder (subclass of all Ruby binders) implements BindDelegate so that:
		  o It creates AST for the rule calling Bind and wraps the result into a lambda
		    exactly like call site binder does. 
			o	If this lambda is interpretable (doesn’t contain loops or other constructs
				that force compilation) it creates an InterpretedDispatcher that  hooks the
				lambda’s “Compiled” event so that it gets called back as soon as compiled 
				delegate is available. Until that happens it dispatches rule invocations
				to the interpreter. 
			o	If the lambda is forced-compiled it uses the resulting delegate right away.
			o	The dispatcher is a generic class generated for Func and Action delegates 
				with 0..15 generic parameters.
		-	Also Adds specs for “include?” used on ClrNames. 
		
		Adds missing type test to singleton rules.

		Ruby’s MethodGroupInfo was doing MakeGenericMethod and then returning the
		generic method.But the types it’s passing in are all generic parameters –
		so the end result is Ruby produces a method for which 
		.IsGenericMethodDefinition is false but it contains all of the original
		generic method parameters.  Now we return the original target so 
		IsGenericMethodDefinition remains true.  Also updated MissingBlockArgBuilder 
		so we can know that it doesn’t really prodive any parameters.  Finally the 
		small set of tests verifying exceptions are throw are updated to expect 
		successful inference.

		Implements CLR member enumeration: methods Module#instance_methods, etc.
		  now include CLR member names.
		Adds IronRuby::Clr::Name class, which represents a pair of names of a CLR 
		  method – the primary name is mangled (Ruby name) the alternative name 
			is the actual CLR name.

		Reflection methods like Module#instance_methods return instances of ClrName
	  whenever a CLR member is encountered that could be called by both names.  
		ClrName has methods to_s, to_sym, to_str, <=>, inspect, dump so that it can 
		be used wherever a string can be used. The display string for the name uses
		single quotes so that you can easily distinguish CLR (dual) names from
		regular names (plain mutable strings).

		>>> System::Byte.instance_methods(false)
		=> ["-", "%", "&", "*", "**", "/", "-@", "[]", "^", "|", "~", "+", "<", "<<",
		    "<=", "<=>", "==", ">", ">=", ">>", "abs", "div", "divmod", "modulo", 
				"quo", "to_f", "to_s", "zero?", "size", 'compare_to', 'equals', 
				'get_hash_code', 'to_string'
		, 'get_type_code']
		>>> l = System::Byte.instance_methods(false).last
		=> 'get_type_code'
		>>> l.ruby_name
		=> "get_type_code"
		>>> l.clr_name
		=> "GetTypeCode"

		Now this works with meta-programming as well:

		class System::Decimal
			instance_methods(false).each do |name|
				mangled = '__' + name
				
				alias_method(mangled, name)
				private mangled
				
				define_method(name) do |*args|
					puts "method called: #{name}"
					send mangled, *args
				end
			end
		end

		x, y = System::Decimal.new(1), System::Decimal.new(2)
		p x + y       # => “method called: +”
		p x.CompareTo(y)   # => “method called: compare_to”

		The trick here is in new set of define_method overloads strongly typed to 
		ClrName that define the real method using the ruby_name and alias it using
		the clr_name. So both CompareTo and compare_to calls are intercepted.

		We might add similar overloads to other methods to improve meta-programming
		experience for CLR types when needed. 

	10-06 (tomat)
		Improves the implementation of singleton method dispatch.

		1)	The previous singleton related shelveset made IRubyObject singleton methods
		    as fast to call as regular methods. Since singletons of Object are frequently
				used in specs, in fact any top level method calls are dispatched to a Object 
				singleton, it makes sense to optimize singletons of Object as well. So far
				we mapped Object to System::Object and Object.new produced an instance of
				System::Object. Since such instances are pretty useless in .NET – they are
				essentially empty objects that you can’t do anything with - it is not 
				necessary to preserve this exact mapping. We still map the Object class
				to System::Object CLR type, but the underlying CLR type of Object instances
				is RubyObject. In pure Ruby program the difference is not observable. On 
				the other hand C# programs will see the instances typed to RubyObject.
		2)	Fixes http://ironruby.codeplex.com/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=761: 
		    Wrong behavior when calling redefined methods on object instances. This 
				is actually fixed by 1) but the same issue applies on CLR singletons. 
				Let’s say we have a CLR class C. Once you create a singleton of any of its
				instance all rules generated for method calls whose receiver is *any*
				instance of C must check whether the receiver is a singleton object of C 
				or a regular instance of C. Previously we did this check only for calls to
				singleton methods. This check is a pretty expensive weak dictionary lookup.
				One way of optimizing this is to reduce the need of these checks. If we are
				sure that no singleton method of the given name has been defined on any
				singleton of C we don’t need to emit this check to the rule. Of course, we
				need to invalidate such rule as soon as such method is defined. 
		3)	Fixes potential race conditions in singleton creation.

		These changes improve running time of specs significantly (2x):

	10-06 (tomat)
		Fixes allocation of structs. A struct can always be allocated by calling new
		or allocate with no parameters or calling its constructor if available.

	07-06 (tomat)
		Initial work to improve singletons.
		•	Improves reflection cache generator – it searches IronRuby.dll for all
		  types marked by [ReflectionCache] attribute and generates ref-cache entries
			for all their methods and properties marked with [Emitted] attribute.
		•	Merges RubyModule.Subclass into RubyModule, i.e. RubyModule now implements
		  IRubyObject.
		•	IRubyObjects now hold on their immediate class (not nominal class) and that
		  reference might change once from a non-singleton to a singleton class.
			This change allows IRubyObject singletons (including modules and classes when
			used in static method calls) to have the same rules as non-singleton objects. 
			The rule no longer needs to hold on such objects.
		•	Implements module freezing: methods, constants, instance and class variables,
			mixins cannot be modified on a frozen module. Besides, if an object is frozen
		  its singleton class is (recursively) frozen as well. 
		•	Fixes object freezing: instance variables cannot be modified on a frozen object
		  (we allowed it).

	06-06 (tomat)
		Fixes Ruby calls to protected generic methods.

	05-06 (tomat)
		Implements lazy method transformation. Previously a method was transformed to 
		DLR AST as soon as it was defined (def foo; …; end). We can postpone the
		transformation until the method is called for the first time. This
		significantly improves startup time. For example (not NGEN’d):

		require 'benchmark'
		Benchmark.bm { |x|   x.report {  require 'rubygems'  }  }

			user     system      total        real
		eager transformation
			1.622410   0.031200   1.653611 (  1.581316)
		lazy transformation
			1.170008   0.031200   1.201208 (  1.099220)

		Although Ruby methods (unlike block) don’t close over variables we still need
		2 closure variables: the parent lexical runtime scope and the module that the
		method is declared in (for implementation of super). These were previously 
		DLR closure variables. They are live constants now. Ruby method 
		pre-compilation would require additional work, so we don’t support it for now.

		Fixes assertion in RubyOverloadResolver - it wasn't expecting DynamicMethod

		Fixes handling of CLR protected and private methods and properties.
		Enables generic methods in ClsTypeEmitter.
		Removes RubyCallFlag.TryCall – it’s not used anymore.
		Fixes calls to Object.Equals instance/static methods.

		Notes on visibility:
		Ruby visibility is orthogonal to CLR visibility.
		Ruby visibility is mutable (can be changed using 
			Kernel#public/private/protected methods), CLR visibility is not.
		A CLR method group can comprise of methods of different CLR visibility. 
		  Ruby visibility applies on the group as a whole.

		Ruby-protected members can only be called from a scope whose self immediate
		class is a descendant of the method owner.
		CLR-protected members can only be called if the receiver is a descendant of
		the method owner. 

		Ruby-private members can only be called with an implicit receiver (self).
		CLR-private members can only be called in PrivateBinding mode
		(-X:PrivateBinding command line option), the receiver might be explicit or
		implicit.

		Tests:
		Since protected methods can only be called on a derived class instance the 
		specs need to be adjusted accordingly.
		I’ve fixed generic_spec nad overload_spec and commented out a block in 
		protected_spec – all the cases there need to be changed to negative cases
		(all should fail).
		Removed ROWAN_BIN check in 
		External.LCA_RESTRICTED\Languages\IronRuby\mspec\default.mspec

      Miscellaneous new tests in File.basename
      Our copy of unit\testcase.rb uses SubclassTracker which is defined in
      "hacks" and so should require "hacks"
    * Map #== and #hash to System.Object.Equals/GetHashCode
    * With the memcache-client gem installed, the Rails tests fail to startup

    Initial COM interop tests for IronRuby. These are just a port of
    IronPython's "app" interop tests. This also changes IronRuby to version 0.5

    Ported  IronPython's DiskUse sample to IronRuby

  13-05 (tomat)
    Adds support from nested types to Ruby – they are exposed as constants on
    the declaring type. Also implements removal of namespace member and nested
    type constants.

    Fixes a bug in autoload – the constant being loaded was removed on a
    wrong module.

    Improves displaying of generic types and type groups: RubyContext.GetClassName
    returns a name of the class without generic parameters or runtime id.
    RubyContext.GetClassDisplayName includes both (runtime id only for classes
    from foreign runtime). The latter is used for displaying errors and for
    object inspection.

    Fixes class instantiation, including bug 
    http://ironruby.codeplex.com/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=1085.

    Several cases need to be distinguished in Class#new:
    1) The class defines or inherits an initializer (“initialize” method) that
       is not the default Object#initializer.
       a. The initializer is a Ruby method (written in Ruby).
          => Use a default constructor to create the instance and invoke the
             initializer on it. If the class derives from CLR class with no 
             default constructor an exception is thrown.
       b. The initializer is defined in a built-in class/module.
          i.  The class being instantiated is a Ruby class.
              Use default constructor and invoke the initializer.
          ii. The class is a CLR class.
              Use constructor or factory. Do not call the initializer 
              built-ins must initialize the object completely in 
              constructors/factories and provide initializers only for a direct
              call.
    2) Otherwise.
       => Use constructor or factory. Do not call the initializer.

    If the first parameter of a CLR constructor is of type RubyClass it is 
    considered optional and hidden (like RubyContext or RubyScope) and the 
    binder passes the class object that represents the class being 
    instantiated.

    Adds support for RubyContext hidden parameter to the constructor generator
    in RubyTypeBuilder. The first RubyContext or RubyClass parameter is
    considered a special hidden parameter. The built type needs to store 
    RubyClass instance to _class field. If the base constructor already has 
    RubyClass the derived ctor has the same signature. If the base constructor
    takes RubyContext the derived ctor takes RubyClass in its place and passes
    its context to the base ctor. If the base ctor doesn’t have RubyClass or 
    RubyContext parameter RubyClass parameter is injected. We also need to
    ensure that we don’t create duplicate constructors (e.g. if there is a
    parameter-less overload, an overload taking RubyContext and an overload 
    taking RubyClass).

    Fixes Ruby.sln so that System.Dynamic is not built in Silverlight configurations.

   Implements IsAscii() on MutableString – the bit is calculated along with 
   hashcode and invalidated each time a mutable operation is performed.
   Enables combination of mutable strings with different encodings/KCoding. 
   If a string is k-coded it should be treated as byte array for all operations 
   since 1.8 doesn’t tag the strings with encodings. Hence any k-coded strings 
   can be combined regardless of their actual encodings. 1.9-encoded strings 
   must have the same encoding or one of them must have all characters in 
   range 0..127 (IsAscii == true) – MRI 1.9 allows combination of such strings.

   Fixes:
    - “IronRuby ignores RUBYLIB environment variable”
      http://ironruby.codeplex.com/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=718
    - Encoding wasn’t flowing correctly in eval (test Encoding4)
    - Improves performance of String#*.
    - MutableString.Content.GetCapacity was wrong.

    Improves performance for file IO#read method.
    Previously we were 10x slower than MRI, now we are approx. 1.5-times faster

  05-05 (tomat)
    Implements Method#to_proc.

    Implements precompilation of simple Ruby method invocations. Adds 
    pre-generated rules for call sites that are:
    1) context bound
    2) without a block, splat or RHS argument
    3) with self of runtime type RubyObject strongly typed to Object in the 
       call site
    4) the method is resolved to an existing Ruby method or an “empty” 
       library method
    5) no context class checks are needed due to protected visibility
    6) the method doesn’t have optional or unsplatted parameters and the number
       of mandatory parameters matches the call site
    7) the method has at most 5 parameters

    The rules are generated to MethodDispatcher.Generated.cs by 
    MethodDispatcher.Generator.rb. The generator finds blocks in C# code that
    match this pattern:

    #if GENERATOR
    <ruby code>
    #else
    <C# template>
    #end
    #region Generated by …
    <generated code>
    #endregion

    It creates a new class G < Generator for each such block end module-eval’s
    <ruby code> in that class. Then it calls G.new.generate. The default
    implementation takes the <C# template> and replaces each occurrence of
    /*$MethodName*/ or /*$MethodName{*/ … /*}*/ in the template by a value
    returned by a call to MethodName on the generator class. The generator
    replaces the content of “Generated by” region by the resulting code. The
    <C# template> is optional – the #else block can be omitted.

    There could be multiple templates in a single file. The generator also
    searches the file for /*$$*/ comments before evaluating them. Text in 
    between such comment and following semicolon is evaluated as a Ruby global
    variable definition. 

    The shelveset also moves event sites (method added/removed/undefined, …)
    to RubyModule and RubyClass so that they don’t become megamorphic.
    Encapsulates class version into VersionHandle class.

    Changes perf stats output writer to a file 'perfstats.log'.

    Enables remaining Method specs. Fixes a couple of failures due to wrong arity calculation.

  03-05 (tomat)
    Fixes a bug in interpreter - if an exception was thrown in finally clause 
    the handler of that exception didn't get executed since the current 
    instruction index was already beyond "endIndex". We need to set endIndex
    to _instructions.Length.

    Ruby: Removes old interpreter.

  01-05 (tomat)
    Fixes bugs in the new interpreter and implements more features to support 
    IronRuby. 

    Fixes bug http://ironruby.codeplex.com/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=572 
    and other eval issues related to control flow.

  28-04 (tomat)
    RubyScope fixes and refactoring.

    This change enables top-level hosted code to define instance methods in 
    DLR scope. It is no longer necessary to define them as singleton methods.
    Ruby engine executes the hosted code as if it was executed using 
    instance_eval on a proc. The behavior is the same except for control flow;
    break or retry on top-level throws an exception as it does in MRI.

    This unit test illustrates the new behavior:

      // When executed without a scope top-level methods are defined on Object
      // (as in MRI):
      Engine.Execute("def foo; 1; end");
      Assert(Context.ObjectClass.GetMethod("foo") != null);

      // When executed against a scope top-level methods are defined on main 
      // singleton (not on Object) and also stored in the scope:
      var scope = Engine.CreateScope();
      Engine.Execute("def bar; 1; end", scope);
      Assert(Context.ObjectClass.GetMethod("bar") == null);
      Assert(scope.GetVariable("bar") != null);
    
    Fixes bug in top-level scope compilation – variables from the scope were
    not bound properly:
    
      var compiled = Engine.CreateScriptSourceFromString("some_variable").Compile();
      scope = Engine.CreateScope();
      scope.SetVariable("some_variable", "foo");
      Assert(compiled.Execute<string>(scope) == "foo");

  25-04 (jdeville)
    - Update to v0.4.0.0

  25-04 (jdeville) 
    From Danielle:
    * IListOps.Difference now uses Object#hash and Object#eql? to check for
      object equality, this fixes the failing spec "Array#- acts as if using an
      intermediate hash to collect values"
    * Modified IListOps.RecursiveJoin to make it flag the resulting string as
      tainted if the given array, at least one of its elements or the separator
      string are tainted.
    * Changed IListOps.Repetition to return IList instances of the same type of
      the given self argument (this fixes also "Array#* with an integer returns
      subclass instance with Array subclasses")
    * Various changes to IListOps.Join to clear all of the remaining tags for the
      specs of Array#join. The tags marked as critical in join_tags.txt are not
      related to pending bugs for Array#join.
    * Added ArrayOps.ToAry as Array#to_a and Array#to_ary behave differently on 
      subclasses of arrays.
    * Cleaning up tags removing expectations that do not fail anymore.
    * Changed one overload of IListOps.Equals to make it try to call #to_ary on 
      the object argument of Array#== and use the resulting array as the actual
      argument for the equality check.
    * Changed IListOps.SetElement to make it try to invoke #to_ary on its argument
      for multi-element sets.
    * Changed IListOps.Reverse to return IList instances of the same type of the
      given self argument (this change also fixes the following failing spec: 
      "Array#reverse returns subclass instance on Array subclasses")
    * Fixed IListOps.ReverseIndex as Array#rindex should not fail if elements are
      removed from the array during the iteration over its elements.
    * Slightly modified IListOps.UniqueSelf as suggested upon review.

    From Jimmy:
    * Allows symbols to be inside a YAML array
      http://ironruby.codeplex.com/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=375
    * Fixes for File.dirname, makes all dirname specs pass. For Rails to find 
      log/development.log
      http://ironruby.codeplex.com/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=499
    * Uses [NotNull] instead of a explicit check.
    * Makes __FILE__ and $PROGRAM_NAME (and $0) have canonicalized paths when
      Ruby is hosted from ir.exe. However, __FILE__ is not messed with when including a file via require/load.
      Fixes http://ironruby.codeplex.com/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=545
    * autoload uses '/' to join load-path and autoload-path
      Fixes http://ironruby.codeplex.com/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=674
    * Code Review changes
    - Moves command_line/fixtures/file* and language/fixtures/file* to fixtures/
    - Create RubyUtils.CanonicalizePath, to dependency on IronRuby.Builtins.Glob
      from IronRuby.Hosting
    * Code review updates:
      - Don't combine paths with '/' if the base-path already ends with '/' or '\\'
      - Remove Glob.CanonicalizePath (in favor of RubyUtils.CanonicalizePath)

    From Jim:
    * remove Glob.CanonicalizePath as requested by Tomas for CR for Jimmy
    * add ci_files to default.mspec so mspec ci works
    * add a filtered function to mspec to simplify default.mspec
    * categorizing uncategorized specs
    * removing extra spec files
    * update rubyspec and mspec
    * add a file with the git sha1 hashes of current mspec and rubyspec
    * implement File.umask in order to run the specs
    * Implement Process.waitall (needed by Process specs)
      Also implement Errno::ECHILD, Process.uid=, Process.wait and Process.wait2
    * rebuilt ironruby tags
    * Code review fixes from Tomas
    * fixing up some missing tags

  23-04 (jdeville)
    From Daniele:
    * Array#first(n) and Array#last(n) on a subclass of Array should return an 
      instance of Array and not an instance of the subclass.
    * The result of Array#compact must keep the tainted status of the source 
      array.
    * A block passed to Array#delete should be executed only if no element 
      matches the given object
    * Array#flatten returns subclass instance for Array subclasses
    * Array#flatten does not call flatten on elements
    * Array#fetch passes the original index argument object to the block, not 
      the converted Integer
    * Removed unused allocateStorage argument from IListOps.First and 
      IListOps.Last; Removed the manual protocol conversion bits in IListOps.Fetch
    * Fix IoOps.ToPrintedString to output a double converted to string using an
      invariant culture (Issue #597 NumericLiterals1 test fails under french culture)
    * IListOps.ValuesAt adds a null value to the result if the begin value of 
      the specified range instance(s) is <= the length of the array and the end 
      value is >= the length of the array.
    * Array#uniq! raises a TypeError on a frozen array if modification would 
      take place.
    * Fixed ArrayOps.ToArray to return a new RubyArray instance with the 
      elements of self if self is a RubyArray.Subclass.
    * Array#initialize with (size, object=nil) uses the block value instead
      of using the default value
    * Fixed IListOps.Compare to work with recursive arrays.

    From Shri:
    - Adding the RubyGems 1.2 tests
    - Included the 1.3.1 tests as well. They can be used when IronRuby moves up
      to RubyGems 1.3.1 (which is what MRI 1.8.6p287 uses)
    - Added Scripts\RubyGemsTests.rb to run the RubyGems tests in the IronRuby 
      dev environment
    - Added an optional task (use "irtests.bat -all") to irtests.bat to run the
      RubyGems tests. We can enable it by default once more people can try it
      out and make sure it works well
    - irtest.bat now runs in series by default. Use "irtests.bat -par" to tasks
      run in parallel
    - Calling exit in at_exit should set the error code. This is required to 
      detect if RubyGemsTests.rb succeeded or not
    - Fixes Array#hash to work with recursive arrays
    - Also updated ArraySpecs.recursive_array to produce a cycle of length 3. 
      Previously, it was doing "a << a" multiple times, but this does not 
      increase the length of the cycle above 2. It just increase the number of 
      cycles. This change required an update to many files.
    - Also added a new ArraySpecs.recursive_arrays function which should be used
      when dealing with two arrays (comparisons, merge, etc). I have only used
      it in equal_value_spec and eql_spec for now...
    - Also removed entries from critical_tags.txt since recursive hashing and
      comparison now works.
    - Changed irtests.bat to not use "mspec -V" (unless you are using "irtests -par")
      which was causing very verbose output
    - Changed irtests.bat to only use two "mspec" tasks so that "irtest -par"
      will spawn fewer processes.
    - Changed IronRuby.Tests.exe to show dots for each test instead of printing a
      new line which is very verbose
    - Changed irtests.bat to continue running tests even if previous test task 
      failed. It remembers the failed results and prints the summary at the end.
    - Added ruby19.bat so that "mspec -tr19" runs with Ruby 1.9. It requires
      you to set RUBY19_EXE to point to your copy of the 1.9 version of ruby.exe
    
    From Jirapong:
    - fix File.new by re-throw exception
    - format indent style
    - added RubyErrno.cs to IronRuby.dll, move EEXIST, EINVAL, and ENOENT 
      to IronRuby.dll
    - move RubyErrno's exceptions to exceptions.cs

  15-04 (jdeville)
    Changes from Shri (Include changes from Jira and Daniele):
    * Implemented Zlib::GzipWriter.open
    * Added Kernel.abort
    * Mapped Errno::EACCES to System.UnauthorizedAccessException
    * File.delete catches IOException and rethrows Errno::EACCES to match MRI
    * Adds Errno::EXDEV
    * Updated rbconfig.rb to work with the dev environment. 
      Change RbConfig[:ruby_install_name] to "ir". Note that it is not "ironruby"
      because RubyGems uses this to spawn new processes for running setup scripts
      , and so it needs to match the executable name (ir.exe).
    * Added Languages\Ruby\Tests\Interop\uncategorized_spec.rb as a place for devs
      to add CLR tests. Jim can later move them into the right place in CLR interop
      test suite.
    * fix missleading FileMode refer to
      http://rubyforge.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=25116&group_id=4359&atid=16798
    * Fixed another bug in String#%
    * Bugs in File.rename
    * Ruby should exit when main thread exits, even if other threads are still alive
    * Mapped Errno::ENOENT to FleNotFoundException, and 
      ENOTDIR to DirectoryNotFoundException
    * fix kernel.open with permission parameter
    * Fixes on top of Jirapong's fix for Kernel.open
    * Fixes File.expand_path to workaround a problem "igem i rails" was running into.
    * Fixes File apis to throw correct exception type
    * Implements Kernel.abort
    * Adds Errno::ECONNREFUSED
    * Exception#message should call Exception#to_s
    * Fixes paths in rbconfig.rb to work in dev environment
    * Fix the behaviour of Array#[]= with [start, length]
    * Delete tags for Array[]=
    
    Changes by Jim:
    * refactor method specs to use a shared behavior
    * namespace mapping and method addition specs
    * more namespace specs for adding and removing methods and classes
    * adding specs mixing Namespaces into Ruby classes
    * added specs for enums
    * remove dependencies on ClrAssembly
    * remove ClrAssembly from Ruby.sln. I'm leaving the ClrAssembly in the Git 
      repo so that I can reference it when doing my specs
    * enum reflection specs
    * spec IEnumerable maps to Enumerable
    * spec IComparable maps to Comparable
    * idictionary support specs
    * Ilist specs
    * class modification specs (method addition and removal
    * spec comparable maps to icomparable
    * specs that Int32 is Fixnum and System::DateTime is Time
    * adding System::DateTime instantiation specs
    * interface reflection spec
    * implementing interfaces

  15-04 (tomat)
    Moves old interpreter to Ruby.
    Cleans up scope factories (removes out parameters).
    A couple of other small tweaks.

  13-04 (tomat)
    Adds support for .NET operators (op_* special methods). These methods 
    behave like extension methods so some adjustments were needed in 
    RubyOverloadResolver to handle “self” correctly. 

    Implements bitwise operators on flag enums: each flag enum gets a
    FlagEnumeration mixin that includes &, |, ^, and ~ methods. The 
    implementation is the same as Python have so I factored it out to 
    EnumUtils in DLR.

    Fixes implementation of RubyObject.ToString and Kernel#to_s so that 
    “to_s” is called from ToString on Ruby objects and ToString is called 
    from Kernel#to_s for .NET objects. Also implements ToString on built-ins 
    where it was missing and it makes sense to have it: range and regex. 
    Although Array and Hash implement to_s as well the result is a plain 
    concatenation of string representation of their items (entires). 
    E.g. [“a b”, “c”].to_s == “a bc”. 
    I don’t think adding RubyArray/Hash.ToString doing the same would be
    useful for .NET users.

    Moves Protocols from libraries to IronRuby.dll.

    Implements more DLR interop binders and refactors existing ones.
    Adds support for COM interop to interop binders and Kernel#methods.
    Fixes a bug in Ruby AST that emitted wrong code for an empty AST.

  08-04 (tomat)
    Redesigns the default method binder.
    Implements partially restricted splatting feature in Ruby.
    Replaces calls to obsolete methods of default method binder with those using meta-objects.

    Fixes http://ironpython.codeplex.com/WorkItem/View.aspx?WorkItemId=18379.

    - YAML should allow spaces. eg the trailing \s\t in 
      YAML.load("!timestamp '2009-03-22 00:00:00\s\t'") is allowed
    - Changed igem.bat, irake.bat, etc to work in dev environment where ir.exe
      is not in the path
    - File.expand_path("~") should throw ArgumentError is HOME is not set
    - make orig_name, comment, and split close and finish
    - compile error when pull form irmain, merge in zlib
    - spec for finish, close, oriname, and trying to DRY orig_name and comment
    - make orig_name, comment, close, and finish passed spec.
    - Implements File.chmod
    - File.readable? should return false if the given filename does not exist
    - File.delete should be able to delete a read-only file. This is implemented
      by making the file writable first. This is the only solution I could find.
    - Added debugger visualizer for RubyObject so that VS will display the result
      of to_s in the Watch window.
    - Adds the wrapper script Merlin\Main\Test\Scritps\ir.cmd so that the Legacy
      tests (Ruby\Scripts\test.bat) can pass without any failures.

  28-03 (sborde)
    - Adding unit tests for Ruby's IDMOP support. Failing scenarios are tagged
      with AreEqualBug and AssertExceptionThrownBug
    - Added Languages\Ruby\Scripts\ir_wrap.cmd as the replacement for
      Test\Scripts\ir.cmd which does not exist in GIT. Most of the files are

    Implements atomizer for Ruby call site binders: A new class 
    RubyMetaBinderFactory creates sites and caches them in dictionaries. Sites 
    are either bound to a runtime (RubyContext) or not. Bound sites don’t emit 
    context check, unbound need to. Bound sites don’t take RubyContext as the
    first parameter any more. They can still take RubyScope if needed (such 
    sites have HasScope flag set). Replaces SiteLocalStorage with 
    RubyCallSiteStorage that holds on the context so that it is not necessary 
    to pass RubyContext to the sites stored in the storage. Updates all sites 
    in libraries accordingly.

    Adds –ER command line option that enables tracing of meta-objects (rules) 
    created by Ruby.

    Refactors MetaObjectBuilder to use type restrictions rather than expression
    restrictions.

    Removes RubyClassAttribute.MixinInterfaces – it didn’t work correctly and
    was almost unused.

    Also improves handling of BOM in 1.8 mode – we previously did exactly what
    Ruby does, i.e. report a syntax error from which it is not obvious what’s
    wrong. If –KU is not specified and UTF8 BOM is found at the beginning of 
    the source code, the tokenizer reports a level 2 warning, skips the BOM 
    as if it was whitespace and continues reading the file.

    A couple of breaking changes:
    - Removes ClrString constant. CLR string should be referred to as 
      System::String. 
    - Removes IronRuby library. “require ‘IronRuby’” is no longer needed, IronRuby
      module is now a built-in module.

    Implements integer/float operations for all CLR primitive numeric types (byte,
    sbyte, short, ushort, uint, long, ulong, float). Those integer types that fit 
    in 32-bit signed integer (Fixnum) are widened to Fixnum for all operations. The
    other integer types are widened to BigInteger. Float is converted to double.
    The operations on these types don’t narrow their results even if the values
    fit. For example, (System::Byte.new(1) + 1).class == Fixnum, not System::Byte.
    This might not be optimal for some scenarios. If we find it important we’ll fix
    this in future.

    The implementation takes the operations from FixnumOps, BignumOps and FloatOps
    and moves them to new modules IronRuby::Clr::Integer, IronRuby::Clr::BigInteger 
    and IronRuby::Clr::Float respectively. These are mixed back into the numeric 
    types. Some methods need to be specialized for each types, so we generated C# 
    code for them. Ruby 1.9 script ClrInteger.Generator.rb produces
    ClrInteger.Generated.cs.

    Implements System::Char and System::String methods so that they behave like an
    immutable UTF-8 encoded string (of size 1 character in the case of 
    System::Char). Many methods in MutableStringOps can share implementation with 
    CLR string. There is still a lot of work to be done here, especially to support
    encodings. So for now, to make CLR strings work like Ruby frozen strings to a
    large extent, I’ve implemented method-missing dispatch that forwards to a 
    MutableString.
