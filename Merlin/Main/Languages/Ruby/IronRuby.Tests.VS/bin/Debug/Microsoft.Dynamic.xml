            <summary>
            An object that implements IDispatch
            
            This currently has the following issues:
            1. If we prefer ComObjectWithTypeInfo over IDispatchComObject, then we will often not
               IDispatchComObject since implementations of IDispatch often rely on a registered type library. 
               If we prefer IDispatchComObject over ComObjectWithTypeInfo, users get a non-ideal experience.
            2. IDispatch cannot distinguish between properties and methods with 0 arguments (and non-0 
               default arguments?). So obj.foo() is ambiguous as it could mean invoking method foo, 
               or it could mean invoking the function pointer returned by property foo.
               We are attempting to find whether we need to call a method or a property by examining
               the ITypeInfo associated with the IDispatch. ITypeInfo tell's use what parameters the method
               expects, is it a method or a property, what is the default property of the object, how to 
               create an enumerator for collections etc.
            3. IronPython processes the signature and converts ref arguments into return values. 
               However, since the signature of a DispMethod is not available beforehand, this conversion 
               is not possible. There could be other signature conversions that may be affected. How does 
               VB6 deal with ref arguments and IDispatch?
               
            We also support events for IDispatch objects:
            Background:
            COM objects support events through a mechanism known as Connect Points.
            Connection Points are separate objects created off the actual COM 
            object (this is to prevent circular references between event sink
            and event source). When clients want to sink events generated  by 
            COM object they would implement callback interfaces (aka source 
            interfaces) and hand it over (advise) to the Connection Point. 
            
            Implementation details:
            When IDispatchComObject.TryGetMember request is received we first check
            whether the requested member is a property or a method. If this check
            fails we will try to determine whether an event is requested. To do 
            so we will do the following set of steps:
            1. Verify the COM object implements IConnectionPointContainer
            2. Attempt to find COM object's coclass's description
               a. Query the object for IProvideClassInfo interface. Go to 3, if found
               b. From object's IDispatch retrieve primary interface description
               c. Scan coclasses declared in object's type library.
               d. Find coclass implementing this particular primary interface 
            3. Scan coclass for all its source interfaces.
            4. Check whether to any of the methods on the source interfaces matches 
            the request name
            
            Once we determine that TryGetMember requests an event we will return
            an instance of BoundDispEvent class. This class has InPlaceAdd and
            InPlaceSubtract operators defined. Calling InPlaceAdd operator will:
            1. An instance of ComEventSinksContainer class is created (unless 
            RCW already had one). This instance is hanged off the RCW in attempt
            to bind the lifetime of event sinks to the lifetime of the RCW itself,
            meaning event sink will be collected once the RCW is collected (this
            is the same way event sinks lifetime is controlled by PIAs).
            Notice: ComEventSinksContainer contains a Finalizer which will go and
            unadvise all event sinks.
            Notice: ComEventSinksContainer is a list of ComEventSink objects. 
            2. Unless we have already created a ComEventSink for the required 
            source interface, we will create and advise a new ComEventSink. Each
            ComEventSink implements a single source interface that COM object 
            supports. 
            3. ComEventSink contains a map between method DISPIDs to  the 
            multicast delegate that will be invoked when the event is raised.
            4. ComEventSink implements IReflect interface which is exposed as
            custom IDispatch to COM consumers. This allows us to intercept calls
            to IDispatch.Invoke and apply custom logic - in particular we will
            just find and invoke the multicast delegate corresponding to the invoked
            dispid.

            This method should be called when typeinfo is not available for an object. The function
            will check if the typeinfo is expected to be missing. This can include error cases where
            the same error is guaranteed to happen all the time, on all machines, under all circumstances.
            In such cases, we just have to operate without the typeinfo.
            
            However, if accessing the typeinfo is failing in a transient way, we might want to throw
            an exception so that we will eagerly predictably indicate the problem.

            We will emit an indirect call to an unmanaged function pointer from the vtable of the given IDispatch interface pointer. 
            It is not possible to express this in C#. Using an indirect pinvoke call allows us to do our own marshalling. 
            We can allocate the Variant arguments cheaply on the stack. We are relying on the JIT-compiler to do

            The alternative of calling via a managed interface declaration of IDispatch would have a performance
            penalty of going through a CLR stub that would have to re-push the arguments on the stack, etc.
            Marshal.GetDelegateForFunctionPointer could be used here, but its too expensive (~2000 instructions on x86).

            This class implements an event sink for a particular RCW.
            Unlike the implementation of events in TlbImp'd assemblies,
            we will create only one event sink per RCW (theoretically RCW might have
            several ComEventSink evenk sinks - but all these implement different source intefaces).
            Each ComEventSink contains a list of ComEventSinkMethod objects - which represent
            a single method on the source interface an a multicast delegate to redirect 
            the calls. Notice that we are chaining multicast delegates so that same 
            ComEventSinkMedhod can invoke multiple event handlers).
            
            ComEventSink implements an IDisposable pattern to Unadvise from the connection point.
            Typically, when RCW is finalized the corresponding Dispose will be triggered by 
            ComEventSinksContainer finalizer. Notice that lifetime of ComEventSinksContainer
            is bound to the lifetime of the RCW.

            ComEventSinkProxy class is responsible for handling QIs for sourceIid 
            on instances of ComEventSink.
            
            Background: When a COM even sink advises to a connection point it is 
            supposed to hand over the dispinterface. Now, some hosts will trust
            the COM client to pass the correct pointer, but some will not.
            E.g. Excel's implementation of Connection Points will not cause a
            QI on the pointer that has been passed, however Word will QI the
            pointer to return the required interface.
            
            ComEventSink does not, strongly speaking, implements the interface 
            that it claims to implement - it is just "faking" it by using IReflect.
            Thus, Word's QIs on the pointer passed to ICP::Advise would fail. To
            prevent this we take advangate of RealProxy's ability of
            "dressing up" like other classes and hence successfully respond to QIs 
            for interfaces that it does not really support( it is OK to say 
            "I implement this interface" for event sinks only since the common 
            practice is to use IDistpach.Invoke when calling into event sinks).

            <summary>
            If a managed user type (as opposed to a primitive type or a COM object) is passed as an argument to a COM call, we need
            to determine the VarEnum type we will marshal it as. We have the following options:
            1.	Raise an exception. Languages with their own version of primitive types would not be able to call
                COM methods using the language's types (for eg. strings in IronRuby are not System.String). An explicit
                cast would be needed.
            2.	We could marshal it as VT_DISPATCH. Then COM code will be able to access all the APIs in a late-bound manner,
                but old COM components will probably malfunction if they expect a primitive type.
            3.	We could guess which primitive type is the closest match. This will make COM components be as easily 
                accessible as .NET methods.
            4.	We could use the type library to check what the expected type is. However, the type library may not be available.

            In general, there is a many-to-many mapping between Type and VarEnum. However, this method
            returns a simple mapping that is needed for the current implementation. The reason for the 
            many-to-many relation is:
            1. Int32 maps to VT_I4 as well as VT_ERROR, and Decimal maps to VT_DECIMAL and VT_CY. However,
               this changes if you throw the wrapper types into the mix.
            2. There is no Type to represent COM types. __ComObject is a private type, and Object is too
               general.
