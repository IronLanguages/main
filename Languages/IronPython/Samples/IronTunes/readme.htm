<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p class="Normal">IronTunes is a music player built upon the IronPython
framework and utilizes several Windows libraries to play music
files. For example, COM Interop is used to connect to the DirectShow
API which in turn plays the actual files. This simply means that we do
not
have to implement the code to convert audio files to actual sounds
ourselves. Additionally, IronTunes uses
a Windows Presentation Foundation based graphical
user interface. One of the major benefits of using WPF from IronPython
is that it makes writing GUIs very easy.</p>
<p class="Normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Normal">IronTunes comes with two separate GUIs to showcase that you 
can design UI independently from the code.&nbsp; To see this, save a copy of 
CurrentSkin.xaml, and copy NewSkin.xaml over CurrentSkin.xaml.&nbsp; Then 
re-launch IronTunes.&nbsp; NewSkin.xaml adds a seek slider and images for the 
buttons.&nbsp; Use the thinner plus-sign button to add an individual file and 
the thicker plus-sign button to add an entire directory.<br>
</p>
<h2>Using IronTunes</h2>
<p class="Normal">
To start IronTunes, run "ipy.exe IronTunes.py" from
the IronTunes directory. Add files by clicking the "Add File" or "Add
Dir" buttons. The files you add will show up in the library view below.
You can select a file and click "Play/Pause" to start playing it. <br>
Typing in the search box in the top right will filter the library as
you type.<br>
The other features work pretty much as expected: Back, Forward, and
Volume Control. Information about the currently playing track is
displayed at the top in the center.</p>
<h2>COM Interop and General Explanation of How IronTunes Functions</h2>
<p class="Normal">IronTunes uses quartz.dll (in the system32 directory) by 
generating an interop assembly with the tlbimp.exe tool.&nbsp; See the 
IronPython tutorial for more info. The Player object (player.py)
constructs a FilegraphManagerClass object from quartz.dll via the interop 
assembly QuartzTypeLib.dll.&nbsp; Player calls into the FilegraphManagerClass 
object to play the audio files. The Player object calls the RenderFile method
with a filename to setup the filter graph to render the file. Then it
can call the Run (to play), Stop, and Pause methods. The Player object also registers
the program's main window with the filter graph manager to send
notification messages. In order to handle these there is an extra wndproc hooked into the main window which sends notifications to the
player object when it needs to respond to filter graph events (it calls
the ProcessEvents method). This allows the program to advance to the
next item on the playlist when an item finishes playing.<br>

<h3><a name="Generating_the_COM_Interop_Assembly_"></a>Generating the
COM Interop Assembly<br>
</h3>
<p class="Normal">For this example
to run, it is
required that you create the quartz (i.e., DirectShow) interop assembly
on your own by following these simple
steps:<br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p class="Step">Open the &quot;Visual Studio
2008 Command Prompt" from the start menu.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="Step">Change the current directory to Samples\IronTunes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p class="Step">Use the tlbimp tool to
generate the interop assembly for quartz (tlbimp writes to the current
directory):</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p class="TypedExample">tlbimp
%SystemRoot%\System32\quartz.dll<br>
<br>
</p>
<p class="Step">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
C:\IronPython\Samples\IronTunes&gt;tlbimp
%SystemRoot%\System32\quartz.dll<br>

<h2>Windows Presentation Foundation</h2>
<p class="Normal">IronTunes builds a
new WPF window and loads the XAML
file CurrentSkin.xaml. It then sets the window's DataContext to be
the application's dataModel, so that the bindings in the XAML file can
allow the user interface to reflect the program's state. It also
creates an IronTunesWindow object (IronTunesWindow.py) and uses its
enliven method to attach event handlers to the buttons.
</p>
<h2>Library Management</h2>
<p class="Normal">The Library class
(library.py) manages the current
music library. It implements the functionality of adding files and
directories (recursively) to the current library, and allows the
current library view to be filtered and sorted (by a SearchFilter
object implemented in SearchFilter.py).</p>
