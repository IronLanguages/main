<h1><a name="HowToUse">How To Use FMsynth</a></h1>
<img src="fmsynth.png">
<p class="Body"> Using FMsynth, you can define a frequency modulation
synthesizer by combining any number of carrier and modulator wave
sources together. You can then listen to your synthesizer by specifying
a test frequency and clicking "Play", or by clicking a note on the
piano keyboard. You can load and save synthesizers using XML files, by
clicking on the "Load Synth" or "Save Synth" buttons. </p>
<p class="Body"> A synthesizer is made up of carrier and modulator wave
sources. A synthesizer can have any number of carriers, and each
carrier can have any number of modulators, and each modulator can have
any number of modulators. Modulators affect the frequency of the wave
they are modulating - by adding modulators to wave sources you can
create very interesting sounds! </p>
<p class="Body"> Each wave source has a type which is "sine", "square",
or "sawtooth" - these are the three wave types FMsynth knows how to
generate. You can see the differences between these by playing a single
carrier source set to one of these types, and observing the drawing of
the waveform. Each wave source also has either an absolute frequency or
a ratio. A ratio setting causes the wave source to change its frequency
based on the base frequency selected. Ratios allow you to create
synthesizers that will play different notes when different keys on the
piano keyboard are clicked. Each waveform also has an amplitude, which
affects the volume of a carrier with respect to the other carriers, or
the magnitude of the effect of a modulator. </p>
<p class="Body"> There are a number of sample synthesizers provided in
the "synths\" folder. Some of these samples are musical in nature,
while others use very low frequency modulators to create sound effects.<br>
</p>
<p class="Body">To run the synthesizer, simply issue the following
command from the FMsynth folder:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <big><span style="font-weight: bold;"><small>ipy.exe
fmsynth.py</small><br>
</span></big> </p>
<h1><a name="Design">Design and Implementation</a></h1>
<p class="Body"> The source code for FMsynth is split into two Python
source files. </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li class="Normal"> fmsynth.py contains the code to create the user
interface and handle user interface events. </li>
  <li class="Normal"> fmsynthlib.py contains code for the BufferPlayer
and WaveSource objects, which generate all of the sound data and
interact with DirectSound. </li>
</ul>
<h1><a name="UserInterface">User Interface</a></h1>
<p class="Body"> The user interface code is located in fmsynth.py. Some
of the more interesting methods are described below. </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li class="Normal"> createUI() is run when the program is launched,
and sets up all of the user interface elements. This method sets
coordinates, text, and other properties for each control, adds event
handlers to the necessary controls, and adds each control to the form. </li>
  <li class="Normal"> pianoClick() is the event handler for clicks on
the piano picturebox. It uses findPianoNote() to determine which piano
key was pressed, and then uses noteToFreq to convert this note number
into a sound frequency. It then utilizes play() to begin playing a
sound buffer at that frequency. </li>
  <li class="Normal"> load() and save() are the event handlers for
clicks on the "Load Synth" and "Save Synth" buttons, and present
OpenFileDialog and SaveFileDialog objects to the user. If the user
chooses a file, the BufferPlayer is used to either load or save an XML
file describing the current synth. After a file is loaded, load() uses
buildTree() to populate the TreeView control with WaveSource nodes. </li>
  <li class="Normal"> buildTree() is a recursive method used to add
nodes to the TreeView control after a synth is loaded. It traverses the
BufferPlayer's tree of WaveSource objects, creating a node for each
WaveSource and setting that node's Tag property to the WaveSource
object. </li>
  <li class="Normal"> stop() and stopall() are the event handlers for
the "Stop" and "Stop All" buttons, and stop buffers that the
BufferPlayer is currently playing. </li>
  <li class="Normal"> play() is the event handler for the "Play"
button, and starts a buffer playing at the current base frequency. </li>
  <li class="Normal"> paint() is the event handler for the form's Paint
event, and draws a waveform image of the current sound on the form. The
data for this image is generated by the BufferPlayer as it generates
the actual sound data, and is saved as BufferPlayer.drawdata. </li>
  <li class="Normal"> addCarrier() and addModulator() are the event
handlers for the "Add Carrier" and "Add Modulator" buttons, and add new
nodes to the TreeView control and new WaveSource objects to the
BufferPlayer. </li>
  <li class="Normal"> removeNode() is the event handler for the "Remove
Source" button. It removes a node and all of its children from the
TreeView control, and removes the associated WaveSource and all of its
modulators. </li>
</ul>
<p class="Body">There are also several methods which are event handlers
for when user interface controls are changed, which are fairly
self-explanatory.</p>
<h1><a name="BufferPlayer">The BufferPlayer Object</a></h1>
<p class="Body"> The BufferPlayer class is defined in fmsynthlib.py,
and is responsible for managing DirectSound buffers as well as mixing
all of the carrier signals of a synthesizer together. It also reads and
writes XML files which contain synthesizer definitions. </p>
<p class="Body"> The addBuffer() method creates a new DirectSound
buffer to store sound data at the provided base frequency. It creates a
DirectSound.WaveFormat object which is initialized to describe
1-channel, 16-bit, 44100 Hz PCM audio. It then creates a
DirectSound.BufferDescription object, and sets the BufferBytes property
to the desired buffer size. findGCDFreq() is used to calculate the
smallest buffer size which will still be long enough to contain an
entire cycle of audio for this particular synthesizer. Finally, a
DirectSound.SecondayBuffer object is created, filled with audio data by
genWaveSources(), and added to the bufs dictionary. </p>
<p class="Body"> The genWaveSources() method generates audio data from
each carrier wave source, normalizes and mixes them together, and then
writes the audio data into the SecondaryBuffer. This method also fills
the drawdata array which is later used to draw the audio data on
screen. The audio data is mixed in two passes. In the first pass, each
audio sample is summed together, and the maximum sample is found. In
the second pass, the audio data is normalized using the maximum value
found before, and is converted from floating point numbers to unsigned
integers in the appropriate range for the DirectSound buffer. The final
audio data is then written to the buffer using SecondaryBuffer.Write().
</p>
<p class="Body"> readXML() creates an XmlDocument object which is used
to load the synthesizer XML file. FMsynth iterates through the child
nodes of the BufferPlayer node. As it encounters WaveSource nodes, it
creates new WaveSource objects and calls readXML() on these objects,
having each WaveSource read its own properties from the XmlDocument.
writeXML() works similarly, first writing the root BufferPlayer node
and then having each WaveSource write itself to the XML file using an
XmlTextWriter object. </p>
<h1><a name="WaveSource">The WaveSource Object</a></h1>
<p class="Body"> The WaveSource class is defined in fmsynthlib.py and
is responsible for storing the parameters for each wave source as well
as generating audio data. It also provides methods for reading and
writing wave sources as XML data. The WaveSource class is a base class
which is inherited by SineSource, SquareSource, and SawSource, which
implement algorithms for generating the different wave source types. </p>
<p class="Body"> Each WaveSource has a list of modulators, where each
modulator is also a WaveSource. prepModData() generates the audio data
for each modulation source, while addModData() combines and returns the
modulation data for a given sample. </p>
<p class="Body"> Each child class of WaveSource implements the
genData() method, which generates the audio data. This method
calculates the number of samples needed for a complete cycle, and then
generates this many samples of data. It then uses fillData() to repeat
that data for the full length of the buffer. </p>
