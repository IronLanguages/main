<p class="title2">PowerShell from IronPython</p>
<p class="body">A brief example which utilizes managed Windows PowerShell APIs to run shell commands directly from IronPython.</p>
<p class="body">&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p class="contentsheading">Overview</p>
<p class="Body">PowerShell (PS) is a new command-line shell for Windows which provides some pretty dramatic improvements over 
its predecessor - the DOS prompt. The most important new feature PS provides as far as IronPython is concerned 
is a set of managed interfaces accessible via the Common Language Runtime. We 
can tap directly into these from IronPython.</p><p class="Body">Utilizing PS from IronPython offers quite a bit 
more to developers than the standard Python modules used to run commands, manipulate the filesystem, etc. This sample 
includes two Python scripts, each of which are designed to determine if your host meets some of the minimum system requirements to 
play the game &quot;Age of Empires III Trial Edition&quot;. What sets these two scripts apart is that the first script, minsysreq_ps.py, leverages a helper module, powershell.py, to obtain 
PS functionality in a very useful and 
object-oriented way. The second script, minsysreq.py, uses PS commands directly to 
achieve the same results.</p><p class="Body">Note: the scripts distributed with this sample collect various performance 
and runtime info about your PC and emit this to the console for your own personal use.&nbsp; None of this information is 
transmitted to Microsoft.</p>
<p class="contentsheading">Prerequisites</p>
<p class="body">The prerequisites to successfully run the PowerShell from IronPython demo are:</p>
<ul>
	<li class="normal">IronPython 2.6 distribution

	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p class="contentsheading">Getting Started<br>
</p>
<p class="body">Please make sure the sample folder <i>IPPowerShell </i>(where this readme.htm is located)<i> </i>
contains at least the following:</p>
<blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		<p class="body">.\minsysreq.py</p><p class="body">.\minsysreq_ps.py</p><p class="body">.\powershell.py<br>
		</p>
	</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class="body">HINT: if the folder containing the IronPython distribution
is not already in your PATH environment variable, please add it from the command 
prompt you'll be working in.&nbsp; By doing this you will be able to run the &quot;ipy&quot; 
command from any arbitrary directory: </p>
<p class="style5"><strong>s</strong><span class="style3">e<span class="typedexample"><strong>t 
PATH=%PATH%;%ProgramFiles%\IronPython 2.6</strong></span></span></p>
<p class="contentsheading">Using powershell.py from an Interactive IronPython Session</p>
<p class="body">From the command prompt, navigate to the <i>IPPowerShell</i> directory and type the following command: </p>
<p class="typedexample">&gt; ipy.exe -i powershell.py</p><p class="typedexample">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="body">This starts an interactive IronPython session and imports quite a few modules, 
functions, objects, etc. into the global namespace. Most importantly you should find a &quot;shell&quot; object. &quot;shell&quot; 
is an instance of the Shell class (defined within powershell.py) which in turn is a wrapper for the standard PS 
cmdlets and aliases. You should take special note that the conversion from PS to IronPython involved the 
following rules with respect to Shell's methods:</p><ul>
	<li>
	<p class="body">for every PS cmdlet, there is a corresponding Shell method where the name is completely 
	lowercase with &quot;-&quot;s translated into &quot;_&quot;s.&nbsp; E.g., the PS command &quot;<b>Get-Process</b>&quot; becomes the Shell method 
	&quot;<b>shell.get_process()</b>&quot;</p></li>
	<li>
	<p class="body">for most simple PS aliases, there is a corresponding Shell method where the name is 
	completely lowercase with &quot;-&quot;s translated into &quot;_&quot;s.&nbsp; E.g., the PS alias &quot;<b>ls</b>&quot; becomes the Shell 
	method &quot;<b>shell.ls()</b>&quot;. Aliases that do not directly map into a corresponding 
	PS cmdlet (such as &quot;more&quot;) have no Shell method mapping.</p></li>
	<li>
	<p class="body">if a PS cmdlet accepts (non-parameter) arguments, they are supplied directly to the Shell 
	method in the form of a single string parameter. E.g., the PS command &quot;<b>Write-Error &quot;Some error message 
	here...&quot;</b>&quot; would become &quot;<b>shell.write_error(&quot;Some error message here...&quot;)</b>&quot;</p></li>
	<li>
	<p class="body">cmdlet parameters are mapped as keyword parameters of Shell methods.&nbsp; E.g., the PS 
	command &quot;<b>Get-Date -DisplayHint date</b>&quot; becomes the Shell method &quot;<b>shell.get_date(DisplayHint='date')</b>&quot; </p></li>
	<li>
	<p class="body">the return value from one cmdlet can be piped in as the input to another cmdlet. To do this, one just needs to invoke the 2nd cmdlet method on the return value of the first cmdlet.&nbsp; E.g., the 
	PS command &quot;<b>Get-Process ipy | ConvertTo-Html</b>&quot; becomes &quot;<b>shell.get_process(&quot;ipy&quot;).convertto_html()</b>&quot;</p></li>
	<li>
	<p class="body">properties of the return value object from a PS cmdlet are accessible as Python object attributes.&nbsp; 
	E.g., the PS command &quot;<b>Get-Process ipy | Select-Object -First 1 -Property WS</b>&quot; becomes &quot;<b>shell.get_process(&quot;ipy&quot;)[0].WS</b>&quot;&nbsp;
	</p></li>

<p class="contentsheading">Checking Minimum System Requirements for AOE III Trial 
Edition</p>
<p class="body">Included with this sample are two scripts designed to automatically determine if your system is capable 
of playing Age of Empires III Trial Edition by using PS API(s) from IronPython. The first script, 
minsysreq_ps.py, uses the nice PS wrapper module powershell.py, while minsysreq.py uses the managed PS assembly directly 
to achieve the same goal. Furthermore, both scripts will emit some runtime information such as memory usage if AOE III 
is currently running. This serves as a nice example because the standard Python modules provide little support for 
obtaining this type of information.</p><p class="body">To run these scripts it is necessary to issue the following 
commands from the <i>IPPowerShell</i> directory: &quot;<b>ipy.exe minisysreq_ps.py</b>&quot; and &quot;<b>ipy.exe minsysreq.py</b>&quot;. The output for both of 
these scripts should be identical and similar to the following:</p><p class="body">&nbsp;</p>
<table border="0" width="100%" height="36" bgcolor="#E6E6E6" cellpadding="15" cellspacing="1">
	<tr>
		<td height="36" width="523">
		E:\Ip\IronPython\Samples\IPPowerShell&gt;ipy minsysreq.py<br>
		This program will determine if your PC meets some of the<br>
		minimum system requires to play the game, Age of Empires III Trial.<br>
		<br>
		Your CPU is fast enough (2.211Ghz)!<br>
		<br>
		256 MB is enough video memory!<br>
		<br>
		Have a nice day!</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p class="body">&nbsp;</p><p class="body">If you are 
already running AOE III, you'd also see the following extra output:</p>
<table border="0" width="100%" height="36" bgcolor="#E6E6E6" cellpadding="15" cellspacing="1">
	<tr>
		<td height="36" width="523">
		It appears as if you're currently running Age of Empires III Trial !<br>
		The game is using 77 megs of RAM and has a process ID of 3956.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p class="body">&nbsp;</p><p class="body"><font size="4">Please explore the contents of both scripts in the <i>IPPowerShell</i> 
directory to assist you in using PowerShell from your own IronPython scripts and modules! </font></p><p class="body">&nbsp;</p>
